[{"text":"“…just like my conviction that I needed to be seen as white to be worthy, seen as a woman to escape those men who would have beaten me up had they realized they desired a man.”⁣\n⁣\nFairest is a complex coming-of-age memoir that is equal parts tough and beautiful. Meredith Talusan recounts transition in two forms: geographical and gender. Starting off with her childhood in the Philippines, where she always stood out as an Albino “sun child” boy and as she immigrates to the US, where she spends her adolescence as a gay man and how she eventually transitioned as a trans woman. From childhood, there were flecks of neglect from parents and a longing for belonging which would surface as she grows through the years. ⁣\n⁣\nWith typical, old-school Filipino colonial mentality ingrained in her since childhood, the idea of America held great promise for Talusan. As she settles in the US, she often passed as an American and experienced “white privilege” firsthand. This brings upon the realization that whiteness is just an illusion and how prevalent colorism is up to this day. While dealing with confusion with identity, she also had to confront her stand with gender. Eagerly enlisting for a Gender Studies class in Harvard, Talusan educates herself in gender, sexuality and queer theory. She makes us privy to her clandestine awakening as she explores through her sexuality with hookups, trips to baths and her romantic relationships. Erratically and viscerally, she narrates her evolution from being a gay man with a fervent desire for womanhood until eventually deciding to become a trans woman. ⁣\n⁣\nThis memoir is honest, sometimes frustrating and in the end, liberating—fearlessly reflecting on the complexities of gender, race and identity. I know that I will never be able to fully understand Talusan’s plight in its entirety but it was an awakening to hear her story. ⁣\n⁣","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/251529944_438800167618885_6703659700307281280_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=zb91HwWf72gAX9B_I0c&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDagT8ko3-1B-aCQv-nJuWFJ5_9TSm8TO46hXc5gZ1SzA&oe=636E0C1B&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"✨TOP MEMOIR READS OF 2020✨ [ thanks to the tagged publishers for the gifted books ]\nI'm sharing stacks of some of my top reads of the year in various categories, leading up to my top ten books of the year.

I became an avid reader in middle school thanks to a friend of mine. One of the first books that I read and fell in love with was this one. I actually took it home from the school library for the summer. I gave it back, don’t worry. Many years later I bought my own copy and its still the great book I fell in love with.\n\n This book is another telling of “Snow White” story but with more depth and more magical creatures . I fully recommend this book. It’s a trip. It explores beauty standards and self-acceptance. ‘Cause beauty it’s in the eye of the beholder, you know?\n\nEspañol:\nSTORY TIME.

I wanted people close to me to see an albino person who had learned how to look and act white so the world would more readily accept her, and understand how that had been a key part of her survival.” \n\nI know I’m super late to this one, but! Definitely another addition to the best queer memoirs to add to your library! I started this one digitally last year and put it down, but I am so so glad I picked it back up this year because it is truly incredible. From her time as a child in the Philippines, to her tenure at Harvard passing as a white, blond gay man, to her post-Harvard years and her transition, Meredith tells her story with grace, care, intelligence, and nuance, and I was hooked. Her meditations on intersectional self and the many different ways she could have been happy in other kinds of lives if she had made different choices really resonated with me, as someone who also is constantly thinking about the road not traveled and the path not taken. Pick this one up ASAP, friends! And just look at that perfectly beautiful rainbow paperback cover for Pride! 😍🌈 \n\n[ID: I am crouching down toward the camera, wearing jeans ripped at the knee?

I do! While I think it's important to keep a good balance and read plenty of hero-centric novels, there's something about getting a villain's perspective that can make you think about the whole story in a new way.⠀\n⠀\nToday's #FTCbeautyandthebeast prompt is 'enchanted mirror'. I think the cover of Marissa Meyer's novella 'Fairest' fits pretty well, although the mirror itself isn't enchanted! In the universe of the Lunar Chronicles, mirrors work the exact same as in our world: they show the truth, whether it's pretty or not. No matter how often the villain looks in the mirror, the outcome is always the same. She can fool everyone else, but not the mirror—and not herself.⠀\n⠀\n#books #bookstagram #marissameyer #fairestbook #lunarchronicles #booksinthewild #fairytale #reading #villain #villainstory","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/203180085_780886399277076_7344422326108900947_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=WWwQcrxi2UwAX8VQQ6n&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBz19t7G7ATjS-d9bmC9fMnbf6szetkWKiJmwVpHlKtKg&oe=636ECD52&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"#FridayReads📚 \n\n\"I know you must be hurting now, but don't give up hope on future happiness, and all the good things that are still to come for you.\"\n\n- Marissa Meyer (Fairest - The Lunar Chronicles)\n\n#fridayreadings #fridayreadsandcoffee #readtolearn #readtobroadenyourmind #readabooktoday📚 #booklovers📚 #bookscanbecool #bookscanbefun\n#dontgiveuphopeonfuturehappiness\n#shakeoffthenegativevoices #nothinginlifeiswasted #selfloveisneveraneasyjob #marissameyer #fairestthelunarchronicles \n#thelunarchronicles #levanasstory #queenlevana #fairestbook #fairest📖 #marissameyerquote #marissameyerquotes❤️ #booksempoweryourvision #makebooksyourbestfriend \n#thepowerofbooks📚","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/142950639_778311829782334_873484605637178366_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=fpJTVdbniBEAX99L6Zt&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBhRLZdeOeTVtGPNUmOldZV4qdFVVjPPiCaxiMMaznQ0g&oe=636E5B4B&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"It was sunny today☀️it was also -17 degrees when I woke up, but I’m takin the win 🥰☀️🐶 Reading “Fairest” by Meredith Talusan. \n.\n.\n.\n#sunchild #anakngaraw #read #reading #nowreading #diversespines #diversebooks #memoir #memoirs #fairest #fairestbook #bookish #bookstagram #bookstagramnorway","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/143335666_230274211986003_2013437848636197643_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=LSBtZP7rgQcAX9wLrP8&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDfXG13Pe6tJH0-uRlPbCDf3CauVHcvbQ1l7OM6_qMrbA&oe=636DF884&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"🌟BOOK REVIEW🌟\nSpoiler Free 👑\n\nFairest by Marissa Meyer:\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5\n\nI have been putting off reading this book for SO long. I got it right after I finished reading The Lunar Chronicles because I was sad the series had ended, and I needed more time with the characters. Then, for some reason, I never got around to reading it. After a bit of time had gone by, I wasn’t as obsessed with the series anymore so Fairest went way down on my TBR.\n\nThat being said, I’m SO happy I finally picked up this book! (Thanks @bookwaffles for pushing me 😂) It took me a little bit to get into it, but I think that happens to me with all books these days. It was fascinating to learn about Levana’s villain origin story. It made me view her as much more complex than I did initially. This story deals with themes of self-esteem, unrequited love, and familial abuse. For being such a short book, I cannot stop thinking about it!\n\nI love how Meyer pulls you into the fairytale, and effortlessly incorporates powerful quotes into the narrative. If you enjoyed The Lunar Chronicles, I highly recommend this book. I feel like even non-readers of the initial series could love this story.\n\nThe only thing that kept Fairest from being 5 stars is that is didn’t absolutely WOW me. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely enjoyed it, and it’s still on my mind a week later. But it wasn’t AMAZING if you know what I mean. Swipe to see some of my favorite quotes from the book. 💗\n\nQOTD: Do you enjoy reading re-tellings of fairy tales?\n\n🌟HASHTAGS🌟\n #bookishlove #booklove #bookishgirl #bibliophile #bookblogger #bookishescape #booksofinsta #bookaddicted #bookishphotography #bookphotos #bookishfeature #mybookfeatures #alyssasbookshelf #booksbooksbooks #bookish #booksta #bookdragons #instabooklovers #bookaddiction #marissameyer #bookreview #fairestbook #thelunarchronicles #yabookreview","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/139772574_5526374147388254_5648053553784586506_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=u2lIm4BUPocAX-BM7O6&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfB4GWbM9CjNCbaZMVkZtfY6F73tvaKFXZVXn06rYnv6pA&oe=636ED497&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"🐈‍⬛ If you could choose to be any animal, which would you pick and why?🐈‍⬛\n\nI’ve always loved dolphins because the ocean is gorgeous and dolphins seem so happy and carefree. 🐬 But in realty, they’re actually sort of jerks, so maybe I’d pick a cat because they get to sleep so much, they basically own their humans, and maybe I could read over my human’s shoulder. 😂\n\nSpeaking of kitties, this handsome black cat is Andy, and he belongs to my sister. 💗 He is very sweet and much smarter than Charlie. 😂\n\n📖 What are you reading this week?📖\nI’m hoping to finish Fairest by Marissa Meyer today! 👑 I wasn’t enjoying it for the first thirty pages or so, but I am definitely hooked now. 💗\n\nIt’s fascinating to learn about Queen Levana, her family, and how everyone got to the place they were at the beginning of The Lunar Chronicles. Plus, the story is surprisingly deep for how short of a book it is. I’ll post a full review after I finish the book! 📖\n\nAnyway, I hope you all have a great Tuesday! ❄️\n\n——————————————————-\n\n🐈‍⬛HASH TAGS🐈‍⬛\n#thelunarchronicles #fairestbook #booklover #bookshelves #booksarelife #queenlevana #bookaddicts #bookstagramcommunity #booksbooksbooks #mybookfeatures #reader #readmorebooks #yalit #ineedmorebooks #alyssasbookshelf #booknerd #bookaesthetic #rainbowshelfie #yabooks #ilovereadingbooks #readingissexy #readingismylife #bookstagramchallenge #bookstoresaremyhome #bookstagrammer #booksta #touchmyshelfie #shelfiesandselfies #turningpagesforlife #marissameyer","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/135793359_439328330575023_7758064876031569502_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=2pJmXMJbMzgAX9f3SAC&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAYw-C2pZ6ohdyPoHyq9J6QP8u5hQIWvqnNa-OETCSEWg&oe=636E8518&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Cinderella wants you to check out our wonderful selection of fantasy/adventure stories, handmade books, bookmarks and postcards on #Etsy! 🤩\n\n.\n\n(Link in bio) #fairestpublishing #fairest #fairestofthemall #fairesttrilogy #fairestbook #fairestbookmark #fairestpostcard #fairytale #handmade #book #booklover #bookmark #postcard #etsy #etsygifts #etsycoupon #etsyshop #etsystore #cinderella #glassslipper #fairygodmother #fantasy #freeshipping #fastandfree #freedelivery (Australia-wide) #worldwideshipping #worldwidedelivery available #expressshipping #expressdelivery available","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/119160992_211794390281511_5854687514693543574_n.jpg?stp=c135.0.810.810a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=jF8ZiIXRpvwAX_RH-cf&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAOt0KfCoNdID1slZevJWiYRV6Otm4h2gmqKRwjVZNxkw&oe=636E8A87&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Fairest by Marissa Meyer is a companion novel to The Lunar Chronicles series, and I’m reading it as a part of my reread! This book tells the story of Queen Levana, the evil ruler of Luna. As she grows from a teenager to an adult, her ambition takes her down a very dark path, making her into the villain she was in the original series. This book was really well written, although it has a very different feel from the rest of the series. This book was less action packed and more of a deep dive into Levana’s character, which made it much more disturbing than the others. The author did an amazing job portraying Levana; at times, this book almost made me feel bad for her. Also, the way she justified her terrible actions and thought she was going the right thing was really cool; it made her a well rounded villain. A lot of YA villains don’t have much depth, but Levana was definitely an exception. It was also interesting to see Channary’s character, since she was only mentioned in the main series. If you enjoyed The Lunar Chronicles this is a must read! I would give it a 9.4/10!\n.\n.\n.\n#tlc #thelunarchronicles #thelunarchroniclesseries #marissameyer #marissameyerbooks #fairest #fairestbook #cinder #scarlet #cress #winter #villianbackstory #villianbooks","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/118214883_187786916071243_8039139899080888561_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=6gTX201RVoMAX9GE67Q&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBMJMECUXaI-S5G-5TflzLVbpGE0VzbNms7omSM-1U5Yg&oe=636E6549&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of @marissameyerauthor's Lunar Chronicles series and so I was so excited when I found out that she has two other books set in the same world!

La trama es muy interesante porque se trata de la propia historia de la villana de estas crónicas, Levana me parece un personaje roto y destructor, es capaz de cometer terribles atrocidades y de no dejar nada a su paso si así lo desea. Lo que hizo, lo que le hizo a los personajes... ah, es terrible y yo me quedé asqueada y con impotencia en el corazón con lo que le hizo a un hombre, que si ya leíste la historia sabrás de quién estoy hablando 😭, nooo. A pesar de todo eso, me encantó la narración de la autora y su manera de engancharte a la historia, es genial. No podía parar de leer porque quería saber cómo terminaba. \nRecomendación: El libro se lee después de haber leído “Cress” ya que de esa forma podrás comprender el siguiente libro de “Winter”.
