A classic and a true story!! It will for sure bring tears to your eyes. \n📚 📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚 A little about the book:\nCorrie Ten Boom is an unmarried woman who worked with her father and older sister at their watch shop. They were strong believers of the Bible. When World War II began, they began to house Jews who where in danger of being captured. With the help of family and friends they saved many Jews but can they save themselves? I guess you will have to read the book to find out!😉\n\nThis book is an amazing history book, but it does have some violence and descriptive death scenes. So I recommend this book for YA and above. I give this book⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ because it teaches us the history of our world and what it was like for Jews and other people in World War II. Even my dog @izzyminipoo likes the  book!🐶 Happy reading!! \n\n#booksandmydog #christianhistory #goodreads #thehidingplacebook #corrietenboom #booklover #mustreadhistorical #doglife🐾 #doggoreads","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/107369139_1590698114443789_498414138280778811_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=b2osApp3ifgAX9TWoJj&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCXbclvBMg1d0NQxlDm7Z7Ita0gEzRAMGsibQiJRkLaJA&oe=636E870F&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Oh wow.

The girls’ faith was poignant and bold – praising God for even the fleas in their barracks, which they only later learned were the reason that the guards did not come in to rape and harass the women as they did the other women.  Corrie made this simple, yet profound statement. \n\nJesus has already overcome the world.  He has defeated sin and eternal death, and is delaying the end of the Age for the salvation of many.  But the war is already over, the end has already been written and we know that He will bring all of His own into His final rest.

Joe claims that he wants to give back to the community, but he actually returned to the former mining village because of an anonymous email: “I know what happened to your sister. It’s happening again.” Joe is determined to avenge his eight-year-old sister, Annie, who went missing decades ago, but there are forces conspiring against him. Further complicating matters are a vicious loan shark and the apparent haunting of Joe’s new house. Flashbacks to 1992 gradually reveal what tragedy befell Annie, while sharply drawn characters illustrate the cyclical natures of violence and victimhood. Joe’s dark humor may balance the grim plot, but the epilogue is the stuff of nightmares......
