[{"text":"Half of the Yellow Sun¬†is set in 1970s Nigeria, balancing truth and fiction. Writer beautifully wrapped  a story of love, loyalty, betrayal, resilience and hope, in between the war. Through Adichie‚Äôs prose, we are offered a glimpse into the lives of several very different and multifaceted characters who are all determined to survive in the Free State of Biafra.¬†This book gives voice to the survivors and causalities of the war.¬†Half of a Yellow Sun¬†provides the reader with an experience that humbles, informs, and ensures that such stories are not lost in history. It is a tale that eloquently demonstrates what it means to be human, to confront your own mortality, to fight for a cause, to be vulnerable, and to be at war with oneself in the midst of political turmoil.\n\n#booksbooksbooks #lovetoreadüìö#readingisfun #readingtimeüìñ #adichie #halfofayellowsunbook #readabook #bookstagram #booklover #words #readmorebooks","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/128761141_396642414719707_6336881049906840293_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=SeZ4NmBv-eoAX9wIMlS&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfABlCeZXdvkt38Cy2dYURJdOHYVEasCCald1ySRD_z-uA&oe=636F58FA&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"//Half of a yellow sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\n\nStarvation was a Nigerian weapon of war. Starvation broke Biafra and bought Biafra fame and made Biafra last long as it did. Starvation made the people of the world take notice and sparked protests. Starvation made Zambia and Tanzania and Ivory Coast recognize Biafra. Starvation made parents all over the world tell their children to eat up. Starvation made the International Red Cross call Biafra its gravest emergency since the WW2.\n\nBefore getting into this book, I was oblivion to how the Nigerian civil war was fought, who Gowon and Ojukwu were, what Biafra was, and who Igbo, Yoruba, and Hausa tribe were. Upon entering into the well-crafted world of Adichie, I began to absorb like a sponge, too much at a time and giving little away. In the mornings, the sky was like a calm sea, by the evening, planes started flying low and fear spread throughout the body, red blood flowed across the streets, soldiers marched past and gently stroked the dead bodies to see if there was any life left. The half of a yellow sun glared from the torn sleeve of the soldier and later on the flag of Biafra. The only people left alive constantly muttered under their breath - \"If the sun refuses to rise we will make it rise\". Some knew they had to run before they're a dead piece. But, they couldn't muster the energy to move their scrawny hands and legs. They could only run and escape in their thoughts and pray to God to not be butchered in front of their family.\n\n‚ÄúRed was the blood of the siblings massacred in the North, black was for mourning them, green was for the prosperity Biafra would have, and, finally, the half of a yellow sun stood for the glorious future.‚Äù\n\nBut war is not the only central theme here. With war, we have the story of a family, love, infidelity, friendship, and betrayal intersected in the lives of Ugwu, Olanna, and Richard. \n\n(continued in comments)\n\nüåøWhich is your favourite book based in Africa?","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/152333718_3856669931063111_9082814121447748760_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=B4_bHlV73Q4AX_2OZrD&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCafWwRxtJNkRSynYcom9o34asl0OdEztVAZ8J2rMVIBg&oe=636DFFFD&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"#photography #ghphotography #art #explore #exploreeverything #cinnamonrolls #tea #halfofayellowsunbook #benafbakes","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/142227325_1125399831249375_2933056989154965486_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=aulfOdlqeuoAX_SgNUb&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD9Qqo_ucJp-gNZ3Z0LwcF0OVbmwRtLOBXWOZYLePuNnQ&oe=636FA25D&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"This one has my soul ‚ú®\nsuch a wonderful read. masterpiece, i must say.\nonly words i have is 'choose love love and love, always and life will follow'. they say love happens to us when we are living but the truth is life happens to us while we are loving. \n\na must read ü¶ã\n\nbooksbooksbooks #lovetoreadüìö#readingisfun #readingtimeüìñ #adichie #halfofayellowsunbook #readabook #bookstagram #booklover #words #readmorebooks #amancalledoveüìñ #absolutelove #40rulesoflove‚ù§ #rumi #shamsoftabrizÿ±ÿ≠ #sufi #lovereadingbooks‚ù§Ô∏èüìö #mustread","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/138410281_2725283401058010_3458951785812305890_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=fA01bhAaXo4AX9MjIZm&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfB4qxPPKyJ5rnfnxeyZY7TZ34V1RJh0sqni8NwQFSAfLQ&oe=636F95EB&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Ahh ! \nA man called OVE ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nThose who have read the book knows what 'a man called ove' is and they know he is LOVE üçí\nOVE - 59 year old grumpy man. \nAt first, i found him very rude, arrogant man but soon i unraveled a different one and i started adoring him for what he really is. one, whose heart is wider than the sky, deeper than ocean and softer than flowers. \nToday, where love has been playing a secondary role, i found Ove giving the whole nostalgia about what the Love is, by loving his wife even after her demise, giving HOPE. \nThe character development is so strong, that i felt like hugging Ove and i really did hug the book. \nTrust me, it's the book, you need to pick, you will not regret. \nin today's world, we really need to be a man called OVE ! ‚ô•Ô∏è\n\n#booksbooksbooks #lovetoreadüìö#readingisfun #readingtimeüìñ #adichie #halfofayellowsunbook #readabook #bookstagram #booklover #words #readmorebooks #amancalledoveüìñ #absolutelove #amancalledove ‚ô•Ô∏è","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/128241418_657407178286871_5673143449571041723_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=kN8A7UGulGQAX_94UwR&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfC9MfWetMn1KH047FmwlROVTYGXmrB1eIBzqmrBeTBYFA&oe=636E55F6&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"\"How can the land belong to any of us?

The African society has reduced mental health to mere excuses for not acting as expected of you. The community will remind you to be content, that unlike some, you are a complete biological being not missing a limb or toe; how lucky can one be? Definitely, jamming of the mind like everything else is solved by a pot of chicken or palm wine. \nAs old and odd as that can be, I have no intention to awake our ancestors. They say, Let the bygones be bygones.\n\nI worry about every little thing. I struggle with insomnia, conversations in my sleep which I don‚Äôt remember a word the following day, self pep talks and the ‚ÄòI should haves‚Äô. Nobody knows the dark side of our lives. It is lonely in there. I face my fears and struggle to be free daily. It may be anxiety or depression, or maybe it‚Äôs just part of the journey. It is very easy for society to condemn you as a social or a self-absorbed person. Your family and acquaintances may never understand because no one can ever relate to your mental struggles. \n\nOne time I told my friend how I was struggling with anxiety and that I was praying for God‚Äôs grace. He quickly shunned me down and said that I couldn‚Äôt pray away what seemingly I had brought upon myself. So I shut my door, I pray a lot more for grace, and I promise you, it gets better every day. \n\nMental health is considered a taboo in most African societies. We do not talk about it even in our families. Neither schools nor churches teach about mental health. Our brains are the most essential part of our body but even getting to that therapist office is damn expensive. Recently, I took a journey to rediscover myself through other people‚Äôs stories. In this journey, I met master Odenigbo struggling with alcoholism after the death of his mother in the Biafra war. Olanna was traumatized, having seen many dead bodies, including that of her uncle and aunt. \n\nTo be continued‚Ä¶..\n\n#mentalhealth #relationshipgoals #africanwriters #bookloverkenya #bookstanzania #chimamandangoziadichie #halfofayellowsunbook #flb_series","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/260067515_920339012209995_3891536095145411076_n.jpg?stp=c0.172.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=1xEKEuJcG1EAX9lO6xQ&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBTZaEQQ_nSMNNYIZjfff49MnvtF7bieXAA4A2XoxLiag&oe=636DF88A&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Hi there! \n\nIf you've still not read any of Chimamanda Adichie's book, then I highly recommend this one.

The¬†Nigerian-Biafran civil war¬†lasted from 1967-1970 and was marked by extreme starvation and ethnic violence. Ethnic tensions fostered by the British played a major role in the war.

Thirteen-year-old Ugwu is employed as a houseboy for a university professor full of revolutionary zeal. Olanna is the professor‚Äôs beautiful mistress, who has abandoned her life of privilege in Lagos for a dusty university town and the charisma of her new lover. And Richard is a shy young Englishman in thrall to Olanna‚Äôs twin sister, an enigmatic figure who refuses to belong to anyone. As Nigerian troops advance and the three must run for their lives, their ideals are severely tested, as are their loyalties to one another.\n\nEpic, ambitious, and triumphantly realized, Half of a Yellow Sun is a remarkable novel about moral responsibility, about the end of colonialism, about ethnic allegiances, about class and race‚Äîand the ways in which love can complicate them all. Adichie brilliantly evokes the promise and the devastating disappointments that marked this time and place, bringing us one of the most powerful, dramatic, and intensely emotional pictures of modern Africa that we have ever had. @chimamanda_adichie #halfofayellowsun #halfofayellowsunbook #chimamandangoziadichie #educateprivate #educate #bookstagram #bookofthemonth #books #lovebooks #nigeria #prizewinningbook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/85173787_2523927324591414_2612965934826513343_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=RyKoWj32lGoAX-ki1_a&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfB79B3sxfaTBxMItF32LQ1hCXo5raIWCqfBhU9zUWHygA&oe=636DD8B7&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"The shop is open again, and I am processing a few stacks of new arrivals.
