There's not much I can say without revealing spoilers, but it is a book that deals with sexual assault, domestic violence, incels, revenge, self-harm, and predatory behavior. The book is more of a psychological mystery, and the multi-perspective plot leaves readers guessing until the very end, breaking down our own stereotypical views of characters. Essentially, Lisa Jewell provides many open avenues, creating a story more complex than a simple \"whodunnit?\"\n\n‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è\n\nI can't say I enjoyed Invisible Girl because it does deal with difficult content, but I will say it's a valuable book. Jewell writes developed characters whose motivations are emotional, driven, and aptly reflect their circumstances. It's also the first book I've read with mention of incels, which brought an added layer of relevancy regarding problematic and vile views toward women. On the other hand, there are so many characters that the story can feel flat at times. As soon as I started becoming entrenched in one character's experiences, I was thrown into another, which stilted my momentum.\n\nRecommendation: Yes!\n\n#bookstagram #books #booknerd #bookreview #bookrecommendations #lisajewellauthor #invisiblegirlbook #booklover  #whatsonmykindle #librarybook #booklife","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/140961347_420363049295913_890023212147951912_n.jpg?stp=c0.1.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=qWYgmisVWjgAX_5fm9l&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDroEz7O124h5SI2FHbrJq3_1iJXRU_LuLFcn1Ni4k3Ow&oe=636ED9EF&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"‚úåüèº Two for Tuesday ‚úåüèº\n\nüìñFeaturing Rebecca Serle, Lisa Jewell, and Colleen Hoover\n\nüíô Ugly Love - TBR\nüíô Reminders of Him - 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è\nü§ç Then She Was Gone - 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è\nü§ç Invisible Girl - TBR\nüíú In Five Years - 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è\nüíú One Italian Summer - TBR\n\nWhich TBR should be my next read? \n.\n.\n.\n.\nüè∑\n#twofortuesday #colleenhoover #lisajewellauthor #rebeccaserle #uglylovebook #remindersofhimcolleenhoover #thenshewasgone #invisiblegirlbook #infiveyearsbook #oneitaliansummer #fivestarbooks #tbrpile #femaleauthors #nexread #bookislove","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/278160604_1441320519634660_5965472318354874416_n.jpg?stp=c127.0.1186.1186a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=fheiy3ZcvtoAX9M6wvh&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBSRM7DbRe-mF2CiIXokxcOT7oTmXGJZvgPqU2X8BJwhw&oe=636F58AF&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"ü•ÄHappy Friday! ü•ÄCould not pass up @jewellwrites latest gem üíé on a Costco üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è after seeing everyone‚Äôs posts and loving the mixin of a great thriller!

After feeling abandoned by him, she starts following him and observing him in his neighbourhood. When Saffyre goes missing, Owen, a creepy, lonely young man across the street from the Fours house is the last one to see her alive. The Fours, Owen and Saffyre stories start to intertwine and culminate on the night Saffyre went missing.. Valentine‚Äôs Day.\n\nThis gives us all the ‚Äúwho can you trust?‚Äù Vibes of a domestic thriller! Lisa Jewell is a master of spinning a lot of characters stories that weave together to intricately it makes for a quick, addicting read! Owen particularly is a bizarre  character and his life on incel websites is hard to read about and yet you can‚Äôt put the book down!\n\nThis was one of the more thought provoking thrillers I‚Äôve read in a while. Invisible Girl is a psychological thriller that has great emphasis on the psychological part! We see human nature, prejudice, and how our past effected our present and future in this story.

The lives of all connected to the disappearance will forever be changed in this psychological drama. \n\nCate, married to Roan, is a blissfully ignorant wife and mother to two children. \n\nSaffyre, a young teen, tries to come to terms with the storm inside her head while still playing the role of a sweet niece and studious, popular girl. \n\nOwen, a typical ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù guy, gets his life turned on its side multiple times throughout the book, who is very unaware of himself and his surroundings in shocking ways. \n\nThe narration of the book alternates between the three of these characters.

However, Lisa Jewell did a great job of presenting a character who was sympathetic and worthy of redemption. That‚Äôs only a small portion for the story. A major theme in the book is sexual assault, so readers should be aware. It does include a graphic telling of an episode that could be trigger inducing. There was some back and forth but it was not confusing at all. There were several characters who could have potentially been the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù, and it was a lot of fun to watch it play out.
