There's not much I can say without revealing spoilers, but it is a book that deals with sexual assault, domestic violence, incels, revenge, self-harm, and predatory behavior. The book is more of a psychological mystery, and the multi-perspective plot leaves readers guessing until the very end, breaking down our own stereotypical views of characters. Essentially, Lisa Jewell provides many open avenues, creating a story more complex than a simple \"whodunnit?\"\n\n❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️\n\nI can't say I enjoyed Invisible Girl because it does deal with difficult content, but I will say it's a valuable book. Jewell writes developed characters whose motivations are emotional, driven, and aptly reflect their circumstances. It's also the first book I've read with mention of incels, which brought an added layer of relevancy regarding problematic and vile views toward women. On the other hand, there are so many characters that the story can feel flat at times. As soon as I started becoming entrenched in one character's experiences, I was thrown into another, which stilted my momentum.\n\nRecommendation: Yes!\n\n#bookstagram #books #booknerd #bookreview #bookrecommendations #lisajewellauthor #invisiblegirlbook #booklover  #whatsonmykindle #librarybook #booklife","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/140961347_420363049295913_890023212147951912_n.jpg?stp=c0.1.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=qWYgmisVWjgAX_5fm9l&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDroEz7O124h5SI2FHbrJq3_1iJXRU_LuLFcn1Ni4k3Ow&oe=636ED9EF&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"✌🏼 Two for Tuesday ✌🏼\n\n📖Featuring Rebecca Serle, Lisa Jewell, and Colleen Hoover\n\n💙 Ugly Love - TBR\n💙 Reminders of Him - 5 ⭐️\n🤍 Then She Was Gone - 5 ⭐️\n🤍 Invisible Girl - TBR\n💜 In Five Years - 5 ⭐️\n💜 One Italian Summer - TBR\n\nWhich TBR should be my next read? \n.\n.\n.\n.\n🏷\n#twofortuesday #colleenhoover #lisajewellauthor #rebeccaserle #uglylovebook #remindersofhimcolleenhoover #thenshewasgone #invisiblegirlbook #infiveyearsbook #oneitaliansummer #fivestarbooks #tbrpile #femaleauthors #nexread #bookislove","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/278160604_1441320519634660_5965472318354874416_n.jpg?stp=c127.0.1186.1186a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=fheiy3ZcvtoAX9M6wvh&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBSRM7DbRe-mF2CiIXokxcOT7oTmXGJZvgPqU2X8BJwhw&oe=636F58AF&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"🥀Happy Friday! 🥀Could not pass up @jewellwrites latest gem 💎 on a Costco 🏃‍♀️ after seeing everyone’s posts and loving the mixin of a great thriller!

This one is also my second read for @readwithangie #thrilleroctoberv2\n\nThe young Saffyre Maddox spent three years as a patient of psychologist Roan Fours. After feeling abandoned by him, she starts following him and observing him in his neighbourhood. When Saffyre goes missing, Owen, a creepy, lonely young man across the street from the Fours house is the last one to see her alive. The Fours, Owen and Saffyre stories start to intertwine and culminate on the night Saffyre went missing.. Valentine’s Day.\n\nThis gives us all the “who can you trust?” Vibes of a domestic thriller! Lisa Jewell is a master of spinning a lot of characters stories that weave together to intricately it makes for a quick, addicting read! Owen particularly is a bizarre  character and his life on incel websites is hard to read about and yet you can’t put the book down!\n\nThis was one of the more thought provoking thrillers I’ve read in a while. Invisible Girl is a psychological thriller that has great emphasis on the psychological part! We see human nature, prejudice, and how our past effected our present and future in this story.

It took me a bit of time the first couple of chapters to wrap my head around the different characters as each chapter is from a one of the 3 main characters perspective; Cate, Saffyre and Owen and because of that I found it a bit of a slow paced book.\nWhen the plot starts to come together towards the end of the book it turns a lot more fast paced and I found I didn’t want to put the book down because I wanted to know what happened\nIf you love Lisa Jewell’s books already you’re going to like this, but if I could only pick one she has better books than this one \n———————————————————\n\n#bookstagram #bookstagrammer #booksbooksbooks #booklover #bookish #bookcommunity #bookblog #ukbookblog #bookloversofinstagram #bookshelf #bookreview #invisiblegirlbook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/162192560_135254151846715_8812924925554380375_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=pOKumbA0jXwAX_o35o0&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD-67kygM_AUBgutH1lYpLXRdtiovxWEDDG8DMCyx_z7Q&oe=636DF8E1&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"The best way to spend a rainy Sunday\nHope you’re having a lovely day however you are spending Mother’s Day🌸\n\n———————————————————\n\n#bookstagram #bookstagrammer #booksbooksbooks #booklover #bookish #bookcommunity #bookblog #ukbookblog #bookloversofinstagram #invisiblegirlbook #lisajewellnovel","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/161263469_577299306559733_87209432445438730_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=2ZL8FCMJ1JwAX-b-xhi&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCfFG91ENl99vSJDhsxKeUg4Mjm4-WkURoCyzSHeG1o-g&oe=636DFD50&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Heel wisselend, de ene keer vind ik haar boek geweldig (Then She Was Gone) en dan vind ik het nauwelijks drie - van de vijf- sterren waard.

A man who is not who he claims to be... And a family caught in the drama between the two. The lives of all connected to the disappearance will forever be changed in this psychological drama. \n\nCate, married to Roan, is a blissfully ignorant wife and mother to two children. \n\nSaffyre, a young teen, tries to come to terms with the storm inside her head while still playing the role of a sweet niece and studious, popular girl. \n\nOwen, a typical “creepy” guy, gets his life turned on its side multiple times throughout the book, who is very unaware of himself and his surroundings in shocking ways. \n\nThe narration of the book alternates between the three of these characters. From there, the reader gets a firsthand glimpse into the terror, misunderstandings, heartbreak, and anxiety that comes along with each one. \n\nINVISIBLE GIRL was such an interesting book- it was devoured in less than a day for me! I found each of the characters fascinating in their own way, but I think I enjoyed viewing the story through Cate the most. Lisa Jewell truly has a gift when it comes to building characters, and this book is a perfect example. The one issue I had was that I wasn’t completely sold on Owen’s seemingly overnight change, but who knows! It most definitely didn’t take anything away from the story, and it was a very enjoyable read.

I wasn’t a huge fan of the Family Upstairs. I ended up loving this! Okay, the incel community has always fascinated me, in a totally disturbing way. I got an up close view with this story, and it was just as cringey and shiver inducing as I thought. However, Lisa Jewell did a great job of presenting a character who was sympathetic and worthy of redemption. That’s only a small portion for the story. A major theme in the book is sexual assault, so readers should be aware. It does include a graphic telling of an episode that could be trigger inducing. There was some back and forth but it was not confusing at all. There were several characters who could have potentially been the “bad guy”, and it was a lot of fun to watch it play out. The end was pretty shocking, even thought not entirely unexpected. ⁣\n⁣\n“𝘐 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘢 𝘥𝘢𝘳𝘬 𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘵, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘐 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘥𝘢𝘳𝘬 𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘨𝘩𝘵𝘴. 𝘐 𝘥𝘰 𝘥𝘢𝘳𝘬 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴.
