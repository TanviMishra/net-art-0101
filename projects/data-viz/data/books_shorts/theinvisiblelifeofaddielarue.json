AHHHHHH\n\nAND OMG DON’T GET ME STARTED ON ‘TIME’.\n\ni related to henry so much in that aspect. his fear of time slipping away, going by too fast, not pausing, really made me relate because i think of time so much and how it is going by so fast. look we are already HALF WAY through the year?!\n-\nPLS the ending was low-key a shocker and MY HEARTTTTT. *wipes a tear* that’s all for today *sigh* hope you enjoyed this, perhaps i made you buy the book, or not, either way, thanks for reading it up until now!\n-\n𝐟𝐚𝐯𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫?\n-\n.\n.\n.","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/210882705_965167640982137_3749549400941006205_n.jpg?stp=c0.153.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=SLfMkssNjIMAX8ghIIt&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAGfLJtcuGUCw71eCM1SRI_ZGu95XY00bCoV_FmYwzwJw&oe=636E7A58&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"What is your reading goal for this year?

Schwab\nRating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5\nReview: SPOILER-FREE \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n♡ “But if you only walk in other people’s steps, you cannot make your own way. You cannot leave a mark.” \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nWell, this was my first book my V.E. Schwab, and holy HELL. I had taken a little break from fantasy before I got to this, which I will be posting the books I read in that time later, but I need a minute to freak over this book.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nInitially, I’d only seen this on booktok, bookstagram, so didn’t know a huge deal about it apart from it looked stunning 😂 but I got started and oh my god, I am now forcing everyone to read this book. \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nAddie doesn’t want to get married. Addie wants to be free. And this leads her to make very possibly the worst deal of her life. She will be free, but the cost is that no-one, NO-ONE, remembers who she is. Additionally, she has all the time in the world to experience her backwards freedom, as she has been granted immortality by a dark, twisted demon. Until one day, someone does remember her. For the first time in 300 years, there is a break in the loneliness.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nI don’t even think that does it justice, but I’m trying not to give anything away, here, just trust me and read this, cause with magic, romance, mystery, and a sprinkling of history, this is just an ideal fantasy escape. V.E. Schwab is becoming an insta-buy author for me! ♡\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n#theinvisiblelifeofaddielarue #theinvisiblelifeofaddielaruebook #veschwab #addielarue #romance #romancebooks #historicalfiction \n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n#bookstagram #readersofinstagram #ilovetoread #booksofinstagram #readingforfun #bookloversofinstagram #librariesofinstagram #bookishcommunity #bibliophilelife📚#writersofinstagram #writingcommunity #bisexualsofinstagram #writinglife #fyp Sent via @planoly #planoly","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/307333735_1254536498679287_8143142420656129671_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=Sr6DqdFkuYkAX8SrCrY&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCI3-Fvlz3Q8fObxWILcmZYLI_0Kbhfyerrn1NGTBegZA&oe=636F640F&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"📖- the invisible life of Addie larue 🤍 \n(This bookmark is one of my favorite thing) \n\n#booksbooksbooks #book #bookworm #theinvisiblelifeofaddielarue #theinvisiblelifeofaddielaruebook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/305844756_134390632666291_7730983311247896952_n.jpg?stp=c207.0.827.827a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=Y63--SJz74UAX_bUypk&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDHIqU33QpA0kS1ymM4Uw0E7YDdX8HiLBbomrYfoVMXig&oe=636EBDE7&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"i wanted to do just books with this 👁️ also, last slide has an honorary mention xo","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/288870865_801136940934205_4726947102184407171_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=X1SXxMzSIKkAX-JMI13&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD49g7R_4N80M1mzQlVQkTWX06rohBNtCGL5bi6LxpWzg&oe=636E411C&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"|𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰| \n\n“the invisible life of addie larue” 🖤\n(swipe left for book description) \n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/ out of 5! \n\nI finally read this book & really enjoyed it! \n\nto addie: you are the most beautiful character.

A boy who lives in New York City ( 300 years later). It follows their journey and how their lives intertwine and how they are a lot more alike than they think , buttttt the Devil doesn’t play fair and of course he gets involved and it’s becomes absolute madness 🫣 This book honestly broke me and we don’t need to talk about it again - thank you for coming to my Ted talk. \n\n#theinvisiblelifeofaddielarue #addielarue #addie #bookreview #bookrecommendations #readmorebooks #reading #aesthetics #veschwab #herny #booklover #bookreviews #theinvisiblelifeofaddielaruebook #love #addielarue","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/301162941_1209691096542370_3468656441295534499_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=aLjEgAJ7o88AX-EU69x&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCYoHvu_X42d9HC-82uiw3Rjvv-EVgRcunGTtH6ECURgQ&oe=636F0A9B&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue by V.E.
