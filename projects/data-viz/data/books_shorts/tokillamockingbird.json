They learn to view the residents of their town with compassion and understanding, rather than bitterness and anger.\n.\n.\nMockingbird explores themes of racial prejudice and injustice as well as love and the coming-of-age of Scout and Jem, Finch's children. It was published just as the United States civil rights movement was gaining momentum and has resonated with readers across cultural lines.\n.\n#tokillamockingbirdbook #equalrightsforall #gregorypeck #tokillamockingbirdquotes #atticusparkcity #atticusparkcityutah #atticusfinch #harperlee #harperleebooks #tokillamockingbirdbroadway #tokillamockingbirdmovie #scoutandgem #booradley #racialinjustice #thinkdifferent #parkcity #historicparkcity","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/293102470_440833241013737_1214751826936020083_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=Ak_hqT9fxj0AX9jPN_W&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfC8ENsNuyAjWEaYujGGNtsg0NNjp56z06IKmhtdaKyrjw&oe=636EFFBA&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"To Kill A Mockingbird \nBy: Harper Lee \n\nCondition: like new \nPaperback \nGenre: classic \nPages: 300+ \n\nOverview: \nThe unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it. \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.\n\nCompassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.\n\nDM for more info.","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/228401507_2967588693568814_4544186783646909625_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=LfDRv64_63MAX9_Ftr9&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAJsq1sRToSx9NdERmJXJhCV019P8obqUd3XjVKCuVoBw&oe=636F9C36&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee\n\nHeinemann Educational Books ü¶äü¶äü¶ä 1985\n\nR25\n\n#affordablebooks \n#alltimeclassic\n#atticusfinch\n#bestsellingnovel\n#booksforsale\n#bookstagramsouthafrica \n#booradley \n#foxybooksharperlee\n#foxybooksavailable \n#harperlee\n#harperleetokillamockingbird\n#internationalbestseller\n#jemfinch\n#mybookshop\n#mybookstoreonline\n#myfavouritebook\n#myonlinebookstore \n#prelovedbookshop\n#prelovedbookssouthafrica \n#pulitzerprize\n#scoutfinch\n#secondhandbookstore\n#southafricabookstagram\n#southafricanbooklover\n#southafricanbookstagram \n#thegreatamericannovel\n#tokillamockingbird\n#tokillamockingbirdbook\n#tokillamockingbirdnovel","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/299367730_379160827709503_323099531656662509_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=edqfQDzjsbwAX-vkp-q&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDoImFepdM3_d-i5_l7wJwSIMYOf81kOaXjoOOauyTuCA&oe=636E9531&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Rabat vibes \n\n#rabat #rabatmorocco #rabatville #rabatcity #rabatvibes #rabatvibesüá≤üá¶üá≤üá¶ #tokillamockingbird #tokillamockingbirdbook #momplus3 #momplus3kids #momplusthree #momplusthreekids #harperlee #harperleebooks","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/243703060_2653855928250496_3673388057611661868_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=TInbZlgN9gAAX_KjRnz&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCiSWQwIAAO61rVzIe30aaQlBMTz-0e7xVegQ1lUV_GwA&oe=636F12B8&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"#tokillamockingbirdbook #harperleelee üëåüòòüëçüôèüíã‚ù§Ô∏èüíØüìñüìöüìôü§î","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/314423801_199461925775159_6996037698528711721_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=vJRPzpP3YCEAX-qZGyJ&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCNJx8mvWTWa9eY6WLlEks_S1ISkdDMthnhkPMi0IveGQ&oe=636E75E7&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"‚ÄúYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...

This touching story is written from Scouts point of view, a girl growing up while battling womanhood. this book is roughly separated by two parts, the first one is about the life and history of Maycomb, the second part  is about how a certain court case didn‚Äôt only affect the witnesses but also the people around them by taking unexpected turns. \n\nI LOVE THIS BOOK i can‚Äôt even begin to explain how much i love it. i don‚Äôt want to spoil too much but all i can say is i loved all of the characters and i loved the way it was written. the start, the story, the plot SO GOOD. i especially loved that there were so many plot twists that weren‚Äôt always sad. i have to admit though that this book is touching and this has definitely become my number 1 comfort book. \n\n#books #bookstagram #bookreviews #bookrecommendations #booktok #bobasbookreviews #tokillamockingbird #tokillamockingbirdbookreview #tokillamockingbirdbook #tokillamockingbirdquotes","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/278186994_534240278045840_2276728479269968718_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=rtMM-a3ruAwAX_G0tRx&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDn6DsoexrlwMhrBmaBD9uQ1OmWfsHDpWoMwfabfo7qSA&oe=636EB80B&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":".\nTo Kill a Mockingbird- Harper Lee\n.\nMy Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è\nPages: 323 \nGenre: Classic, Historical. \n. \n.\nI was actually surprised by this book, mainly because I didn‚Äôt know anything about it and I didn‚Äôt expect anything at all, it was nice, I like the children and their relationship with their father more than anything (I think), it was just a nice book.\n.\nAlso I‚Äôm not  fan of American literature (if it‚Äôs not Sci-fi or Fantasy) so liking a book is a big thing for me. \n.\n.\n.\n#tokillamockingbird #tokillamockingbirdbook #harperlee #historicalfiction #fiction #fictionbook #classic #classicbook #classicbooks #book #read #tea #bookworm #booknerd","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/277921158_4950644151671660_1106551299336267243_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=D6TS8MAfkw4AX__reHS&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBTBIh-AlR7b4iIiQAYKex2zxqO9oOp8qWeWROBCnrKow&oe=636EC0FE&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Review: To Kill A Mockingbird \n\nOk so don‚Äôt fight me because I know how you girls like to tussle‚Ä¶ but I found this ok. I think other people really built it up for me so when I finished the book, I was literally sat there like ‚Äú‚Ä¶ok??‚Äù\n\nI can definitely see how this would have a huge impact on someone. Especially if this were to be read during those formative years. I can also certainly appreciate it in respect of when it was written and the subject it focuses on. \n\nIt was very well written and Scout is likeable and seeing the world through her eyes was nice. I also absolutely adored Arthur Radley, he seemed like a sweet soul. \n\nIf this had been written now, it would be a bit too ‚Äúwhite saviour‚Äù for me but again, thinking about the time period it was written in, I can completely understand how this was (and still is) so thought provoking. \n\nI had mixed feelings about Atticus himself as a parent but that‚Äôs neither here nor there. I felt like it took forever to get to the trial and I wished it had lasted longer. That was probably my favourite part of the book and it didn‚Äôt last long at all, I wanted more suspense. What happened to Tom in the end was also really sad, I guess it was realistic but I wish his story didn‚Äôt end the way in which it did. \n\nI am glad I read it though and will be reading the sequel soon, hopefully. \n\n‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è\n\n#booksta #bookstagram #bookrecommendations #bookstagrammer #bookreview #bookcommunity #bookworm #booknerd #bookaddict #booklife #tokillamockingbird #tokillamockingbirdbook #harperlee","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/277451323_4999412436807482_7331481921689140383_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=qw8dfEE4JW8AX-TdotQ&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfC6y4QoobNop3I0gag-iFmhc9i2_rCo4EnEbKgYBuk4jw&oe=636E9B0C&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Makes you want to read the book, huh? üòç\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookishquotes #favouritequotes #words #wordsofwisdom #wordstoliveby #fitoorcompany #fitoorbooks #tokillamockingbird #tokillamockingbirdquotes #harperlee #harperleequotes #harperleebooks #sundayfunday #sunday #sundayreads #tokillamockingbirdbook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/276074095_1147318292764272_3996250483086664394_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=s42W-m4O1akAX8ibjx5&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAnRwqZUJh6BNI324O00ahQArY6r4tRN2G9oeWQt6rC-g&oe=636E948C&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"\"People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.\"\n- Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\n#tokillamockingbird #tokillamockingbirdquotes #tokillamockingbirdbook #harperleebooks #classicsbooks #classicsbookstagram #bookstoread #favoritebook #americanliterature #americanlit #maastricht","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/275202114_363622895416983_8877260226867119144_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=vCaUvsrNCmQAX_2hPuC&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCYnvNcmBjiTxa_HOxaD0W8t0US3WZmH-9yD3-nrnUZ8Q&oe=636DE923&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"One of the most loved classics of all time.\n\nBook Review üìö\nMy ratings ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nName:  To kill a mockingbird\nPublication:. J.B Lippincott & co.\n\n üçÉüçÉüçÅüçÅüçÉüçÉ\n\n The Winner of Pulitzer prize, this classic novel is mainly based on racism towards black people. The setting of the story is a small town in Albama district of United States during the era of great depression. The story firstly evolves around scout finch, a six years old girl, her brother jem, neighbour friend dill, her father Atticus finch and their surrounding neighbourhood.\n\nThrough the sharp and smart  character of scout finch, the author has raised many serious questions and pointed finger to the unjustly prejudices prevalent on those days regarding racism, poverty and social inequality. The simple story of childhood adventure takes a twisty turn when atticus finch who was a lawyer by profession stood upto defend Tom Robinson, a black man who was accused of raping a white woman. The author very tactfully showed how the black community was targeted often and falsely accused of the crime they didn't committed. How that community even denied of their basic rights. Apart from the black community the author also disclosed the inequality and oppression of women in the society alongside  the hollowness of other social prejudices. \nLastly, this novel also carefully delivers the message of good parenting as Atticus finch teaches his children about ethics, equality and standing up for right even if alone.\n\nMy take on the novel is that what Harper Lee did want to covey that time, is even apt till the present day. Because somewhere in this world still there are people or communities that facing some kind of inequality regarding cast, creed, religion or gender.This novel advocate for those deprived communities. It encourages us to go against the flow to defend truth and justice, as the world very much needs it and thus makes it a must read book for all of us.\n \n ‚òòÔ∏è‚òòÔ∏è‚òòÔ∏è\n\n#worldclassic #harperlee #tokillamockingbirdbook #blackrights #womenrights #bookstagram #indianbookblogger #bookreview\n#americanclassic #booklover #equalrights","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/273567396_652984215898872_8838649076838017770_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=4zz6pYkHBbwAX-OGk1p&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCAHSEDxQ_AXy2JU3koIeR4JVXpth2fYPlwqNJusP0rug&oe=636E98AE&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"ü¶ãŒ§Œø ŒºœÖŒ∏ŒπœÉœÑœåœÅŒ∑ŒºŒ± ŒåœÑŒ±ŒΩ œÉŒ∫ŒøœÑœéŒΩŒøœÖŒΩ œÑŒ± Œ∫ŒøœÑœÉŒØœÜŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ Harper Lee œÉœÖŒ≥Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒµœÑŒ±Œπ œÉœÑŒ± Œ∫ŒªŒ±œÉŒπŒ∫Œ¨ Œ≠œÅŒ≥Œ± œÑŒ∑œÇ œÄŒ±Œ≥Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒπŒ±œÇ œÉœçŒ≥œáœÅŒøŒΩŒ∑œÇ ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøœÑŒµœáŒΩŒØŒ±œÇ.

To be honest, the more I think about this book, the less I like it so for once, I don't think I'm going to review anything. I think I'll only rant. For the actual review please swipe up top (the posted pictures) to read my review because I'm afraid that I'll end up downgrading my rating if I attempt to dissect this book further and I just don't want to.‚ú®\n\n‚ú®The writing was extraordinary but the book was just not and the characters were definitely not either. I forced myself through this one and for the first 51% of this book (AKA part one), I simply didn't even understand what this book was even about! When it finally got to the point, it didn't even dwell on it long enough and that pissed me off. BIG TIME.‚ú®\n\n‚ú®The racism was real. The racism was BEAUTIFULLY penned down but why oh why was it not given as much spotlight as the kids in this book running around in breeches and being nosy with their neighbors? How do you mix RACISM, RAPE and CHILD'S PLAY in a single book and focus more on the child's play? Like HOW??? I'm insulted on behalf of Tom Robinson. ‚ú®\n\n‚ú®Final words: Great, yet overhyped story but wrong POV. I stand by my words that an 8 year old narrating this took away the seriousness from it. Reading her asking her papa 'what is rape?' and him explaining it just made me laugh. I shouldn't have laughed! I'm a woman! This was a serious issue. As serious as racial discrimination. It's JUST NOT FUNNY but I caterwauled! And that is why I have a problem with this book.‚ú®\n\n‚ú®Not to say it was a bad read (although I wished I'd skipped the first 51%) but I just wished it told things better. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.‚ú®\n\nüíúAnyway, my next book in this challenge will by 'Ugly Love' chosen by @aitistic.__ and I'm excited!üíú","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/269828979_1066880734162416_2876326547367077444_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=Z37TThDnm4QAX9FegTq&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBpyQHgQEJX_1kXyR9Fv3ZZG47ITaIcbWDAR3AhRcOyUA&oe=636E781D&_nc_sid=76ac9f"}]
