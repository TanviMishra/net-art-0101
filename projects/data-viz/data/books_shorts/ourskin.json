[{"text":"Monday Morning’s I’m going to have a live with a book we’ve been reading and loving lately.\n.\nPlease consider watching this live and hearing this book “ Our Skin” as it educates toddlers and parents how to go about a first conversation about race.\n.\nMay delete this live later but wanted to encourage and empower you to have these conversations because though I could “ get away with” or shy away from not having these conversations with my kids at this age( 4) because I am a YTE passing Latina and my children are 1/2 Latina 1/2 white , but Im having these conversations with them now as toddlers because I know the people of color in my life are having conversations about being black as early as 2 year old.\n.\nAll this to say my 4 year old now knows about melanin, that anyone can be a princess, and that we can always stand up for others and ourselves and say that’s not right.\n.\n#representationmatters #ourskinbook #antiracismeducation","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/312380045_797103761569052_2718318409488124127_n.jpg?stp=c0.196.504.504a_dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=fm-ADjn7ec4AX_pJyCY&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD73ZDIZHi8XWkqUHKziMyWMr-JG4x4TEKy2EtuAR7bhw&oe=636BAEE8&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Our Skin🖐🏻🖐🏼🖐🏽🖐🏾🖐🏿 \nI read this with my children yesterday and it is such a wonderful conversation starter to have with your children. Several times throughout the book me and my children stopped and we talked about all the different things that they were explaining throughout.  This book really breaks down all the questions that children have at this time about their skin and why racism is a thing! The best part I enjoyed of the book is how they explained melanin in our skin.  \nI would recommend reading this book to anyone who has children of any color. Today’s world is very different from when I was a child and even as an adult I learned so much!  \n \nHas anyone else read this book with their children? Or what other books would you recommend that are similar to this?","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/204591917_2018418638297087_5967447173003080697_n.jpg?stp=c0.106.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=ZhYCixQqfsUAX8ae1oj&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAKJm5P_UpFHG_zUbV5CfOeZNVOGDo-8sBkzAU6Oka8Mg&oe=636DF9D0&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"This new book just arrived and I’m thrilled.

They learnt about Rosa Parks and how she made a difference. \n\nEmmerson has lots of questions about why people have different skin colours and why people are treated differently. She explained to me how her teacher wouldn’t be allowed to be her teacher and how her friends wouldn’t be allowed in her classroom.  She noted this makes her very sad and doesn’t understand why anyone would treat someone differently. \n\nThis book Our Skin does a great job on explaining race at a level that children can understand. \n\nWe still have a lot of teaching to go and Emmerson doesn’t understand that she may mean well but it comes out the wrong way. An example of this below...\n\nWe were walking to the park and there was a boy riding his bike towards us. Emmerson proceeded to say hi and then very loudly said “I said Hi to him even tho I didn’t like his skin Color you need to be kind to everyone. My response “you didn’t like his skin color?” Em “no I mean you should say hi to all people no matter what their skin Color is bc we are all the same on the inside”. I really hope that little boy heard the rest of our conversation and not just the part where she said “I didn’t like his skin Color”. \n\nIts so important we educate our kids about race at an early age!\n\nHave you come across other books or ways to educate your children on race? \n\n#ourskin #ourskinbook #childrensbooks #educatingaboutrace  #educatingchildren #teachingchildrenaboutraceandracism \n#emmersonsbookreview","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/187136555_641714546785386_4786635116636875456_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=vK1IopTSOFMAX88E9uW&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBS9zF0glrJ1x-zWlVePq_ajhOD4qVfolfnpT53pXzm0A&oe=636F0269&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Start the conversation about diversity, inclusion and race with this book.
