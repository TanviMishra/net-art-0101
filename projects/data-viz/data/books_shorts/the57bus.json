[{"text":"long time no see, this is my current read, and i really like it so far! however i‚Äôm annoyed to find out that it‚Äôs banned in some places. people don‚Äôt like it because it has LGBTQ+ themes and revolves around a hate crime. the main character, Sasha uses they/them pronouns and identifies as Agender. other than small displays of violence (which many other books have). the 57 bus is a perfectly fine book that shouldn‚Äôt be banned anywhere. clearly, the only reason it even is banned is because some people don‚Äôt think people like me should be portrayed in books, which disgusts me in itself. but also that this book is a true story and this actually happened to a person, but people wanted to ban the book because they don‚Äôt like the way that someone identifies themself? mind boggling. #the57bus #the57busbook #bannedbooks #bookstagram #books #reading #bookstagrammer #reader #casualbookstagram","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/274158021_969935207231792_222657806428675076_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=Fvu1Zp7Lw6MAX94e9y2&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDuilsQxeim6PLmO3mEwhfTvo54p5Ctd8JFp35Td_gTPQ&oe=636F7FFB&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Hurricane Henri hasn‚Äôt been bad, but enjoying some quiet time to read!

I have the perfect recommendation!\nüìñ\nThe 57 Bus by @princessamanita is about how one skirt can change lives. The writing is so incredible that it reads like a fictional story. One morning a couple years ago I sat down on my couch to start this. Little did I know that a couple hours later after having finished the book, my POV on LGBTQ+ and Black teens‚Äô lives would change forever. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a moving nonfiction book to add to their collection!\nüìñ\nIf it weren‚Äôt for The 57 Bus, Sasha and Richard never would have met. Both were high school students in Oakland, California, one of the most diverse cities in the country, but they inhabited different worlds. Sasha lives in the middle-class foothills and attended a small private school. Richard lives in the economically challenged flatlands and attended a large public one. After school each day, their paths overlapped on the bus a mere eight minutes. But one afternoon, a single reckless act left Sasha severely burned and Richard charged with two hate crimes and facing life imprisonment. The case garnered international attention, thrusting both teenagers into the spotlight. But in The 57 Bus, author Dashka Slater shows that what might at first seem like a simple matter of right and wrong, justice and injustice, victim and criminal is something more complicated‚Äîand far more heartbreaking. .\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîüìñ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n#the57bus #the57busbook #dashkaslater #farrarstrausgiroux #farrarstrausandgiroux #yanonfiction #nonfictionbooks #nonfictionbook #nonfictionbooksforkids #nonfictionbooksofinstagram #nonfictionbookrec #yabookstagrammers #yabooks #yabookstagram #gendernonconformingkids #gendernonconformingpride #gendernonconformingrepresentation #lgbtqbook #yalgbtq #57bus #yabookrecommendation #yabookrecs #booksandclothes #yabook #yabooksofinstagram #bookgirlc","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/105479879_271381250642195_4820615488900955048_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=xnGl-Endi5IAX_Lb0kf&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCx5qvva04ql4pqAPDze6oaS9NRWP3NACckQ4KO8sOH3g&oe=636F0C99&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"My (Tami) crabapple tree is so beautiful right now üå∏ üêù I just had to share the beauty of it!

And I also absolutely loved THE 57 BUS by Dashka Slater. I had seen this book recommended over and over again the past year and now I totally understand why. I finished this one in less than 24 hours, then immediately recommended it to several family members, and then the next day I walked in to class eager to share it with my students! Many times I have trouble getting into nonfiction but this one was intriguing from the start. Two teens on one bus in Oakland, California where a crime occurs that changes the trajectory of both of their lives. What I loved most about this story was the way the author goes backwards to show the lives of these two teens prior to this event. It is so important to be able to see and understand what leads someone to a moment in time. This story shows how simple and easy it can be to judge someone in a passing moment, but ultimately how a judgement can change drastically when you know someone‚Äôs complete story. I think this book is infinitely valuable for the empathy it evokes for the reader but also because of some of the other important topics it focuses on. It breaks down some major inequalities and flaws within our justice system in this country, specifically when it comes to the youth and individuals of specific races. It also focuses on the issues people in the LGBTQ community face on a daily basis. I learned so much. I also felt so much while reading this one.
