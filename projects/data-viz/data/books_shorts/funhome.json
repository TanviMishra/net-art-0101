Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to revisit something familiar and perhaps see it through different eyes depending on what has shifted in my own life. Do you reread books? If so, when and why?\n\nI‚Äôd been meaning to reread Fun Home for a while now, and Pride Month seemed as good a time as any to do so. Fun Home is a graphic memoir in which Bechdel grapples with her father‚Äôs death, recounts her own coming out story, and examines where and how these two threads overlap. The content is compelling in and of itself, but what makes this book so good is the way it is structured: instead of organizing her story chronologically, each chapter is thematically based on an allusion to a specific author or literary classic. This approach could easily come off as pretentious or ham-fisted but the execution is just‚Ä¶ so expertly nuanced that the resulting effect is layers upon layers of reflection and a complex meditation on grief and connection and family and WHEW. Bechdel knows her craft. Check the trigger warnings for sure, but also please go read this RIGHT NOW. It‚Äôs that good.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#FunHome #FunHomeBook #AlisonBechdel #GraphicMemoir #PrideMonth #QueerBooks #QueerAuthors #Bookstagram #BooksBooksBooks #BookWormLife #BookWorm #BookAddiction #ILoveBooks #ILoveToRead #Bibliophile","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/290590291_901883623944054_512468114371649892_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=UobaV1c3VWIAX9nPBRK&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCMlD_rOvdVWdg0FTFQ1Ok2jefJOKv59AtbfbADLTJZwA&oe=636EAA4F&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Fun Home by Alison Bechdel @alisonbechdel \nüëì\nThe subtitle ‚ÄòA Family Tragicomic‚Äô is a perfectly accurate way to describe this graphic memoir. The author tells stories about her father‚Äôs life and their relationship via parallels to famous works of fiction that were important to either or both of them. Both father and daughter are queer and the way that‚Äôs played out throughout their lives is unusual, but that plus the father‚Äôs death make for a really compelling story. It‚Äôs clear that its fewish words are remarkably carefully chosen- many sentences and captions with several meanings. The illustrations were really good; they added clever/funny/telling details. Maybe because I haven‚Äôt read many of the works/authors referenced, or maybe it was the non sequential timeline, but I was a bit lost at times. I‚Äôd recommend this to people who love memoirs, lgbtquia+ literature, and dark humor. (Spoiler: the titular ‚Äòfun home‚Äô is actually a funeral home!)\nüëì\nEven though the dads are very different, the dad from the picture book Gator Dad is also pretty eclectic. Gator Dad, like Fun Home, also has terrific illustrations that really add to the story! \nüëì\n#funhome #graphicmemoir #graphicnovels #whatiread #funhomebook #alisonbechdel #momswhoread #pridemonthbooks #tragicomedy #readersofinsta #june2022 #atozreadingchallenge #readallthebooks #readlgbtqauthors #summerreads","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/287713733_139641785334112_6173495222065041061_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=muf8vWrb97sAX8rkq0h&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAjo9nN7ZkMtZa0TkL5g4n0kDmz4CLhixrnLvZb2Wp0RQ&oe=636F7129&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"I don't usually read graphic novels, but I really liked this one! It was a memoir of the author that told the story of her grieving process after she lost her father, their relationship while she grew up, and the way she wanted to be closer to him. It was really interesting because her father was a very complex character and the author and her father mirrored each other in a lot of ways. There were surface level things they had in common like their struggles with their sexuality and nonconformity to gender roles, but there were deeper things that also made them mirrors of each other. The book also showed her father in roles that we don't see men in a whole lot, like on one page when he was nurturing. It was an engaging coming of age story that took us on a journey with Bechdel! The book gave a lot of insight into her internal struggles, and I appreciate how Bechdel was willing to be so vulnerable. While I read it, I could emphasize with her easily, that's how good she was at writing herself as a character, which I know from experience is nit an easy thing to do! Even though the author and I had very different families and childhoods, this book was still really touching and impactful, I actually cried at the end! \n\n#funhome \n#funhomebook \n#funhomegraphicnovel \n#alisonbechdel \n#bookstagram\n#bookblogger \n#booksbooksbooksüìö \n#booksbooksandmorebooks \n#graphicnovels \n#insightfulbooks \n#impactfulreads","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/217634898_655678552501681_5058272009748243353_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=GO4TDvkNMkUAX_NVyKt&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCnKvW9RmQv_L9t90JSHjjgdd8V0UtQ_BFgSyphwmETIg&oe=636DE5E9&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Quando tutti dormono ed √® solo il rumore del condizionatore a farti compagnia.... e le pareti colorate sembrano fare capolino come animati tessuti pronti ad avvolgerti in un abbraccio per farti accomodare a leggere...

I quite enjoyed Fun Home, but I can‚Äôt quite say the same about Are You My Mother?. I wasn‚Äôt as invested in this one as I was with Fun Home, and I overall didn‚Äôt like it as much and it took me way too long to get through. There are many similarities between the two, but there are many differences as well. Like Fun Home, this one is very honest and personal, and feels almost like a conversation. However, this one feels more external and more like a memoir, with the reader looking into Bechdel‚Äôs life. Whereas Fun Home had more of a plot and linear story structure that was easier to follow and felt more like a novel. On a similar note, a lot of the content of this one focused on Fun Home and how she wrote it. In terms of the art style, it‚Äôs slightly different and is visually darker. Also, while the main colour scheme of Fun Home is green, the main colour scheme of Are You My Mother? is red. I find it interesting that she‚Äôs chosen to use contrasting colours, perhaps to contrast her relationships with her father and mother. Overall, it was a good book and I appreciate it for what it is, but I didn‚Äôt enjoy reading it very much. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è\nDates read: ~ February 8th - March 15th 2022\nReading length: ~ 6 weeks\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n#book #books #greatbook #bookrecommendations #ireccomend #ratreads #bookreview #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #bookish #bibliophile #instabooks #igreads #igbooks #funhome #alisonbechdel #funhomebook #funhomememoir #alisonbechdelfunhome #funhomealisonbechdel #areyoumymother #areyoumymotheralisonbechdel #alisonbechdelareyoumymother","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/278145838_159673566463282_5172365323040140618_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=M82wFSZjzFQAX_k5enK&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfA2ZmAZJkkYuTuRgcmcYtMY88AN99ATI1jePDwMVaR-yw&oe=636E405D&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Fun Home by Alison Bechdel: I had been wanting to read this for a while, so I‚Äôm glad I finally got around to it!
