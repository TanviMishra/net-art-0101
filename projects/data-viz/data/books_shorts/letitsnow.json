[{"text":"have any of you watched any book-to-movie adaptations recently?❄️⛄️🎄\n.\nthe other night, I finally watched the Netflix adaptation of Let it Snow, and although it was enjoyable, I just felt a bit meh about it🙁 I reread Let it Snow almost every single year, and have done for the last 5/6 years. it’s one of my favourite books, so I think because I know the book inside out, I had high expectations for the film. don’t get me wrong, it was super cute and if you haven’t read the book, I don’t think you’d think anything was amiss, but for me, it just wasn’t as quirky or feel as real as the book. \n.\nI also watched the Netflix adaptation of Rebecca a few weeks ago, and it was enjoyable, but it just wasn’t as dark as I wanted it to be. the actors just didn’t seem to fit the roles, and I know I’m not alone in that opinion. if you separate the film from the book, I think it’s quite good, but I’m not sure if you’re adapting a book, that making the film worse is the goal😂\n.\nso although I’ve not had much luck with adaptations recently, it’s still really exciting to see a different take on your favourite books! do any of you have any favourite adaptations? for me, the Perks of Being a Wallflower is a complete standout. and also the 2005 film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is just beautiful😊\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#bookblogger #bookstagram #instabooks #bookstagrammer #bookworm #bookstagramfeature  #amreading #booknerd #booksta #bookgram #livres #writingcommunity  #booklove #bibliophile #currentlyreading #bookshop #bookshelf #mybookfeature #letitsnownetflix #letitsnowbook #johngreen #christmasbooks","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/130302118_154190589778500_8092711946456000603_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=5yONOamUEqYAX9lmnuj&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDicOutDGOdsTtYeBJ2GFXQ0bJoYL1LTtSC1s5G_VPGPQ&oe=636F7BE7&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"-Bästa boken!

O escritor tem aquela maneira de escrever muito própria, impossível de não reconhecer.

I hated everything about Addie and the people around her. But then I realised that was kinda the point, and her journey was actually an enjoyable one, and that ending and the way everything tied back in together definitely brought it back up to a four.\n\nI really enjoyed each of these stories for different reasons. The first was just so funny and so sweet, and the second was such a perfect middle ground with idiot kids being idiots.\n\nI did, however, wanna address the casual use of the word “retarded” in story two and “spaz” in story three. They’re very typical of 2008 lingo (i hope to god it’s not typical of todays lingo but I honestly wouldn’t know), but I think it’s important to address that that’s NOT OKAY. It felt uncomfortable to read and it felt wrong for me to not address it in the review. This book is flawed (for more reasons than just those two words honestly). But I think it’s important to acknowledge flaws in something we enjoy.","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/264441729_1831961513679917_7572318680835449549_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=yYhFuLVfdDwAX9L2eAv&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAJ-lhe3ypEghd5O3VUhMY78c4NGTI02CACJCon_rGoPw&oe=636F0630&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"❄️ BOOKS ON TOUR ❄️\n\nIt’s only September, but it feels like beginning to look a lot like Christmas.

It’s also the first time I’m introduced to this book written by Beth Moran. Since this has a family Christmas-y premise, I’m happy to give myself a try. So, just like the energy and enthusiasm of a kid when it comes to Christmas season, I felt the same excitement to read this book!\n\nIt’s a home-for-the-holidays book that captures the range of emotions tied into saving a family’s legacy in a small town, being true to yourself, finding your true love and trying to keep a family secret just for the sake to cherish every moment with the family. It was totally hilarious and a fun quick read. There were entertaining family curveballs, which had kept me hooked in the story.\n\nThe book also offered a “Hallmark holiday romance” vibe. The romance was a slow burn yet heartwarming in the end. The romantic relationship of Bea (a meteorologist) and Henry (an astrophysicist) was charming. I ended up to found myself rooting for both of them. \n\nOverall, this book could be a good choice for you to escape from the madness of holiday rush or planning during the most wonderful time of the year, Christmas. It is light humor and a feel good book to curl up with a warm blanket and a hot MUG of hot chocolate and lots of toast. Yes! A MUG! Take note of that.

Soon fourteen pumped-up cheerleaders will descend on the local Waffle House, the Duke’s DVD night will be rudely interrupted for a Twister mission, and a lovesick barista will determine the fate of a single teacup pig... As the three stories collide, strangers cross paths and romance blossoms with heart-warming consequences.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️ - A lovely holiday romance book. The chapters are somewhat short which helps to keep wanting to read. I love how all the short stories are entwined with each other and this really becomes noticeable at the end of the last story.

Jest to zbiór trzech opowiadań w tematyce zimowej.\n\nAkcja rozgrywa się w pewną wigilię, której towarzyszy ogromna burza śnieżna. Każde z opowiadań tutaj zawartych jest o czymś innym, chociaż wszystkie mają jeden wspólny temat, którym jest MIŁOŚĆ.\n\nMIŁOŚĆ, do którego chłopaka, którego poznajesz przez przypadek, jadąc pociągiem daleko od swoich rodziców, którzy zostali aresztowani, ponieważ wdali się w bójkę o limitowany ceramiczny domek.\n\nMiłość, którą czujesz do dziewczyny, którą znasz od dziecka i którą traktowałeś jak dobrego ziomka.\n\nI na koniec Miłość do osoby, którą zdradziłeś przez głupią sprzeczkę. Na dodatek wszyscy do okola zaczynają Ci mówić, że jesteś zadufana w sobie i że nie myślisz o innych, więc postanowisz się zmienić.\n\nNa końcu wszystkie te historie się ze sobą łącza w subtelny i magiczny sposób, który mi bardzo przypadł do gustu.\n\nJeżeli lubicie opowiadania, które dzieją się w jednej miejscowości i których bohaterowie pojawiają się w innych historiach, ta książka jest jak najbardziej dla was. Bardzo mi się podobała, jest naprawdę słodka i niewinna, czuć w niej bardzo mocno magię świąt co na pewno jest na plus. Najbardziej podobało mi się ostatnie opowiadanie, było idealnym zakończeniem książki i spięciem wszystkich wątków. Zawiodłam się niestety na opowiadaniu Johna Greena, było najkrótsze, mało rozwinięte i płaskie. Polecam ją na długie zimne wieczory, magiczne historie i relacje pomiędzy bohaterami na pewno rozpala wasze serca do czerwoności nawet w najzimniejszą noc.\n\n#wśnieżnąnoc #letitsnow #letitsnowbook #johngreen #maureenjohnson #laurenmyracle #bookstagrampolska #book #bookphotography #bookstagrampl #bookstagramtopasja #booklover #books #bookstagrammer #booksbooksbooks #bookstagram📖 #bookstagram #booklove #bookaholic #ksiażka #ksiazkadobranawszystko #ksiazkowelove #książki #ksiazkimojamilosc #ksiazkoholizm #książkoholiczka #książka #książkoholik #książkimłodzieżowe  #ksiazkoholicy","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/271980108_194131216213925_4270124646163451885_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=8sbN5ite2-8AX93wts4&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBbTYCAqrH8X4yHxIUFwu4JV8-xhc1ZR09OFkcYDiQDYw&oe=636EAA58&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"QOTD - When was the last time you saw snow? For me, it's definitely been a couple years since it rarely snows where I live. \n\nBetween Christmas and New Year’s I picked up this book since I meant to get to it before Christmas (but finals got in the way lol) and I thought it was an okay read. Let it Snow is a collection of three romance short stories by Maureen Johnson, John Green, and Lauren Myracle which all set in the same small town during a snowstorm. Overall I enjoyed how each story tied together, but since every author writes differently I enjoyed some stories more than the others. I loved Maureen Johnson’s The Jubilee Express which focused on Jubilee who walks off of her train that has stopped during a snowstorm and meets a stranger who she journeys through the snow and eventually falls in love with. I thought Jubilee was a really strong main character and loved her characterization and love story. My least favorite had to be Lauren Myracle’s The Patron Saint of Pigs in part because it focuses on the self centered main character Addie and her quick redemption arc when she picks up her friend’s teacup pig from a local pet store, sacrificing her dignity and comfort along the way. I just found the redemption arc a little bit too rushed and overall didn’t really see it as a romance, although I guess since she ends up with someone at the end of the story and learns to love herself it could be considered one. Overall though, I thought it was a pretty fun read, but didn’t enjoy all of the short stories equally.","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/271534003_275865491198636_2038758153410435740_n.webp?stp=c0.135.1080.1080a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=FZiBLAgKIYQAX_CJAY6&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAtLhrHM4rNKOzLF3DH_fJtNbm3u8Z3KM-6v6V-U_Xehg&oe=636EDB1F&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Let it snow - kolme talvista rakkaustarinaa: Jubilee Express, Lumienkeli-ilmiö ja Sikojen suojeluspyhimys\n\nKirjailijat: Maureen Johnson, John Green, Lauren Myracle\n\nSuomentaja: Inka Parpola, Helene Bützow, Kaisa Kattelus\n\nKustantamo: WSOY\n\nSivuja: 312\n\nGenre: YA\n\nTässä kirjassa on tosiaan kolme rakkaustarinaa, jotka kaikki liittyvät talveen ja joulunaikaan. Kirja on odotellut vuoroaan kirjahyllyssä jo pari vuotta, joten päätin tarttua siihen nyt, kun ulkona näyttää vielä talviselta. En tiennyt etukäteen, että kirjan tarinat liittyvät toisiinsa. Lukemisen lomassa oli hauskaa tajuta, että novelleissa pyörii samoja henkilöitä ja tapahtumia. Mielestäni tarinat kietoutuivat kivasti yhteen!\n\nTykkäsin ensimmäisestä novellista tosi paljon (Jubilee Express). Johnsonin kirjoitustyyli upposi muhun ja tarina oli virkistävän hauska. Haluan kyllä lukea lisää kyseisen kirjailijan kirjoja😍 \n\nLumienkeli-ilmiö ja Sikojen suojeluspyhimys puolestaan eivät oikeen olleet mun juttu. Ihan kivat tarinat, mutta en kuitenkaan päässyt niihin kiinni samalla tavalla kuin Jubilee Expressiin. Näiden kirjailijoiden huumori ei myöskään iskenyt muhun.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nKirja sopii mielestäni seuraaviin Helmet-lukuhaaste 2022 kohtiin: \n\n2. Kirjassa jää tai lumi on tärkeässä roolissa\n\n19.

I was reading this years ago when I was much younger and figuring out the hype surrounding John Green’s writing. A young-adult book of three inter-connected holiday romances, I think ‘Let It Snow’ is generally heart-warming and fits nicely into the genre of hallmark-feel-good vibes of Christmas romances, but that’s about it. It’s rather bland and icky for me, and I don’t really like John Green even though I have read a few of his other titles. I tried re-reading this to see how I feel about it now and I still think a 2-star rating is quite a generous one 😅.
