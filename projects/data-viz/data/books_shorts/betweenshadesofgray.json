[{"text":"As someone who isnâ€™t a big fan of historical fiction, Ruta Sepetys is my go-to author to dip my toes in the waters of the genre. So far I have only read one of these books featured, but they are all on my TBR list. I love to learn, so I hope to get into historical fiction a bit more in order to learn about history in a more fun way. Iâ€™m so excited to read these!! \n\nWhat genres are out of your comfort zones? \n\n#bookstagram #booktok #booktube #bookstagrammer #ilovetoread #historicalfiction #rutasepetys #salttotheseaðŸ“– #fountainsofsilence #imustbetrayyou #betweenshadesofgraybook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/301136239_640163800658555_8707140129175872938_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=xSUSo3SSTxYAX_bS4vh&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfC2dGe4hWWScloIISb-N6vG0HUNMuArxvtM7j1R3AdIcQ&oe=636F6D63&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"âœ¨Between Shades of Gray by Ruta Sepetysâœ¨\n\nðŸ–¤  This book broke my heart over and over again; itâ€™s a fairly heavy read. Set during World War II when Stalin was in power of the Soviet Union, many people were imprisoned and labeled criminals if they were considered anti-Soviet, and were separated from loved ones and exposed to harsh living conditions and hard labor.\n\nðŸ–¤ I feel like these events that happened in Soviet Russia are often overshadowed by the Holocaust since it happened at the same time. Honestly, I canâ€™t recall ever hearing about these work camps in any history class Iâ€™ve ever taken. Sure, Iâ€™ve heard plenty of the concentration camps in Germany, and written research papers on the Japanese internment camps in America, but I have never once heard of this happening in Russia. Thatâ€™s why I believe itâ€™s so important for everyone to read this book at least once, to get a good idea of something else that was happening during World War II. And to think that things like this are still happening today! History always manages to repeat itself. \n\nðŸ–¤ I rate this book a 5/5! It would be great for a high school read; there are a lot of chapters but theyâ€™re only about 3 pages or so, and itâ€™s simple and easy to follow along. There isnâ€™t a lot of attachment to the characters, because letâ€™s face it, weâ€™re not able to truly understand what these people have gone through, but this book was a beautifully heartbreaking depiction of real-life events. Thank you, Sepetys, for shedding light on something the world may not have known about otherwise. \n\nðŸ–¤ Question: With this book being a fiction based off of true events, were you taught about the Russian work camps in History class when covering WWII?\n\n#bookstagram #bookstagrammer #books #newtobookstagram #augustreads #augustreads2021 #betweenshadesofgray #betweenshadesofgraybook #historicalfiction #rutasepetysbooks #rutasepetys #readsof2021 #2021reads #booksof2021 #readsof2021","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/241065864_666558767638335_3332711536567218813_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=yvmERRMl7kUAX-9VmGr&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCe4ktDG2FndRG7hPpzjQEX8EgQZgUb03Ds3uGlH1CG1A&oe=636E5FDF&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Between Shades of Gray by Ruta Sepetys is historical fiction that follows a Lithuanian girl during WWII.\n.\nI am only halfway through so far and I havenâ€™t been disappointed.

A Lithuanian girl, Lina, and her family are taken away from the NKVD along with thousands of other citizens, towards labor camps in Siberia.
