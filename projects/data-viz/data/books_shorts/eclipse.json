[{"text":"BOOK - MIDNIGHT SUN\nAUTHOR - STEPHENIE MEYER \n\nMIDNIGHT SUN,\nMidnight sun is a book I’ve been waiting for so long and let me tell you, it was so worth the wait , THIS BOOK WAS EVERYTHING.\n\nI love how Edward talks about reading his families minds and the different thoughts and struggles.midnight sun is exceptionally longer than the first Twilight book, but it’s within good reason. The amount of detailed thought and description is extraordinary.\nThere are some actions Edward follows through with that are questionable,He is constantly fighting with himself in his internal to be a good person. the way Bella reacts to him in every situation she clearly feels the same. In the two main instances in Twilight where I found Edward’s behaviour borderline creepy, And it’s not just the reader who is wondering what Edward is doing he is constantly worrying and is overly critical of his behaviour too .Edward’s relationships especially; Alice is so so sweet. Honestly the relationships between Edward and any Cullen touched my heart. This was honestly a lot better than I expected it to be. \n\nDefinitely recommend Midnight Sun to Twilight Fans.\n\n#midnightsunbook #twilight #eclipsebook #bookstagram #booklover #bookblog #bookstagrammer #booknerd #books #booklover #bookreview #booknerd #bookworm #bookphotography #bookish #booksbooksbooks  #bookshelf #booksaremylife #bookmoments #bookreviewer #booksofinstagram📚#bookreview #bookblog #bookstagram #asthetics #amreading #booklover #readersofinstagram #favouritebooks","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/132241945_158546692722960_2706386093443948793_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=mw8koWfN-BkAX-SCGk-&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCbgSlEOBEj2XRzGPImqnB66w8gDxoGDafKQv2_RNhQIw&oe=636E9709&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"𝒾𝓉 𝒸𝒶𝓁𝓂𝓈 𝓂𝑒\n#reading #readingtime #book #twilightsaga #eclipsebook #twilighteclipse #twilightaesthetic","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/275322206_1028331548026313_28844653829516509_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=EIDtNQRpAfgAX88KyIG&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCRhnS7ew9NEV53xmEHvE-RAa0FTh_kdxKak3z4a3cppg&oe=636FA56F&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Was I strong enough?

Besides the nostalgia mentioned in the previous post, I loved the family dynamics amongst the Cullens and the character developments we did not get to see in Twilight. ⁣\n⁣\nAlice and Emmett have always been beloved, and their popularity is well-deserved. But to me, Emmett has always been somewhat flat, so I was happy to see an unexpectedly fraternal and tender side of him. ⁣\n⁣\nAnd I also want to apologize for underappreciating Jasper for so many years. His apparent aloofness is probably just a self-defense mechanism for that overwhelming emotional empathy, but both Edward and I learned more about his forbearance, psychological and supernatural in this book. ⁣\n⁣\nI also had a chance to further considered Edward’s characterization. On one hand, he had a century of experience and wisdom; on the other hand, he technically stopped psychologically maturing when he was seventeen. Meyer could have done a better job reconciliating these two sides, but such a paradox also makes him more vulnerable. I can’t say I now blame him any less for leaving in New Moon, but I do understand where it came from. ⁣\n⁣\nOne problem I did have with the entire saga was the crudeness of the writing. The awkwardness of the phrases and repetitiveness of the descriptions had escaped me when I first read the books as a teenager, but I literally put them down for this very reason when I tried to reread them a few years ago. Unfortunately Meyer’s writing does not seem to have improved at all, giving Edward the linguistic style of a poorly educated modern teenager. I understand that Meyer might not be able to write as elegantly as an one-hundred-and-four-year-old with two medical degrees, but please get a better editor next time. ⁣\n⁣\nOr hire me. I can work for free, but only if you promise to write Edward’s version of Eclipse too.⁣","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/117428311_607008006685075_5736094333141658876_n.jpg?stp=c315.0.810.810a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=BqznWLdlzKMAX-CzyQr&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCvcuLUI9wRK-_4_KcyI04zrnqyMjg8wlA7S77tyVsnaQ&oe=636DC1AE&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"📖 BOOK REVIEW 📖 \n\nEclipse - Stephenie Meyer \n\nHappy Sunday Bookstagrammers!\n\nOkay so finishing this book made me launch into binging all of the movies 😂\nI enjoyed this book but not as much as the others, I think because it’s more of a lead up to the final book. \n\n3 ⭐️ \n\nI can really say I’m Team Edward, every part with Jacob in the books just makes me cringe 😂😂 (though I will say in the movies the actors of Bella and Jacob have way more chemistry and it’s more believable)\n\nThere’s not much else to say here, it was good but not amazing! \n\nI can’t wait for the chat with my bookclub to find out what everyone else thought! \n\nHave you tried these chocolate chewy raspberry balls from @darrelllea ?

O leitor percorre pelos capítulos em busca do desfecho de cada evento, esbarrando-se com viradas emocionantes e surpreendentes.\n\n👉🏼 Enfim, a história é muito boa e os personagens estão mais maduros e perfeitamente amarrados. E o cenário durante toda a história é excelente e sombrio. 😊\n\n🌗 Para Bella, Jacob representa o Sol que dissipa suas \"nuvens\", e Edward representa a lua. A proximidade de Bella com Jacob, quase faz deles namorados. A frase que Jacob diz: \"O sol não pode lutar contra a lua num eclipse\". Ou seja, por mais próximo que Jacob esteja de Bella, nunca vai ocupar o lugar de Edward no seu coração. 🫢\n\n🩸A fita vermelha cortada na capa representa a escolha de Bella entre Edward e Jacob, significa também que ela pode acabar com sua vida como humana. O vermelho é para lembrar que se trata de uma história de vampiros, é associado ao sangue de Bella tão desejado por Edward. 😏🙃\n\n❤️‍🩹 Enquanto Seattle é assolada por uma sequência de assassinatos misteriosos e uma vampira maligna continua em sua busca por vingança, Bella está cercada de perigos outra vez. Em meio a isso, ela é forçada a escolher entre seu amor por Edward e sua amizade com Jacob - sabendo que essa decisão tem o potencial para reacender o conflito perene entre vampiros e lobisomens.\n\n🥀 Com a proximidade da formatura, Bella tem mais uma decisão a tomar: vida ou morte. Mas o que representará cada uma dessas escolhas…?!\n\n❝ Das nuvens eu posso cuidar, mas não posso lutar contra um eclipse. ❞\n\n❝ Eu volto logo pra que você não precise sentir a minha falta.

I remember the hope with which I opened my eyes every morning, know that she would be nearby. I remember seeing her for the last time right before she left for another continent, narcissistically thinking that the Philadelphia downpour outside was only an echo of our heartbreak at the inevitable ending. ⁣\n⁣\nHow amusing they all seem in retrospect. ⁣\n⁣\nIt has been years since I have tasted that all-consuming passion, so I am no longer in the mindset that would most resonate with Edward and Bella. Yet reading about them again, after not having touched the saga for years, made me reminiscent. ⁣\n⁣\nFor a moment I was able to feel the tremor Bella must have felt every time she laid eyes on this gorgeous, superhuman being. For a second I could appreciate this “average” human girl as Edward appraised her with incredulous and reverent eyes. ⁣\n⁣\nIt was as if the Midnight Sun were a wormhole that transported its readers back into the 2000’s, to the small rainy town of Forks, and to the pink, delicate idealization of life-transformative love. When the book ended and the coldness of the New Moon re-emerged, this love became ludicrous once more. Yet for a brief moment, my youthful faith in a passionate love was rekindled, and I could not help but suspect that that even loneliest of frozen hearts could learn to beat again.","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/117113159_2646859862193388_5925321746294983389_n.jpg?stp=c315.0.809.809a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=dgRyqSf_nBoAX9D1tNu&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAsi_uus2ozjL3Ybrh7RDm72eIYGL0OOl-DHvajkkPe-Q&oe=636DBFCB&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"The matching Jacob to Edward.
