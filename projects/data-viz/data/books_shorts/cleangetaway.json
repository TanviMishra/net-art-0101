Thank you @randomhousekids for this free review copy! It‚Äôs headed to @katie.reilley today! ‚Å£‚Å£\n‚Å£‚Å£\nBook #2 of winter break did NOT disappoint. I will admit, I worried that this middle grade debut from @nicstone wouldn‚Äôt measure up to her young adult novels but I am SO HAPPY to assure you there is nothing to worry about! Clean Getaway measures up and is PERFECT.‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£\n‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£\nWilliam ‚ÄúScoob‚Äù Lamar heads out on an unplanned road trip with his grandma to get away from his troubles at school only to learn that his revered grandma is also running away from some trouble... but she gets away with things because she‚Äôs a grandma! And because... she‚Äôs white. ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£\n‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£\nThis book is only 223 pages which makes it perfect for an upper elementary or middle school read aloud but, I‚Äôll warn you, you‚Äôre going to need more than 223 pages because you‚Äôll want to stop and discuss. Stopping and talking will be very important to digesting this novel with kids. ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£\n‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£\nContent to be prepared to discuss include: segregation, Emmett Till, interracial relationships (in the 60s and in the SOUTH!), Civil Rights Movement, and Ruby Bridges.‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£\n‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£\nI mention these things because some front loading before reading this book will make the experience so much richer for a young reader and as much as we hope kids know about all of these things, people, events and movements... many of them do not know.‚Å£ Clean Getaway will be out on January 7, 2020. ‚Å£\n‚Å£‚Å£\n‚Å£‚Å£\n#nicstone #civilrights #mgreads #iteachfifth #teachersthatread #readingteacher #iowabookstagram #iowabookstagrammers #bookexpedition #cleangetaway #cleangetawaybook #middlegradebooks #middlegradefiction @randomhousekids","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/75587968_138544117570257_2347838522783446689_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=Fh0Hlpa713oAX-2CklU&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCukZM48ZiXEJOokENs3VVQavr2-b_5pp97Sy5u6RceRQ&oe=636ED595&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Yep, my kid and I read different books by @nicstone at the same time!
