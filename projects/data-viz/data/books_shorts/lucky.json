[{"text":"If you’re looking for me, I’m the one in pj’s at 5:30 pm, holding a glass of wine and my new book…no promises that you won’t still find me here into tomorrow too. 🍷📖\n\nIt may be Monday for most, but it’s the start of my ‘weekend’ after working the last 2 nights. I was so jealous but honestly also happy for all my friends that I saw enjoying their cozy weekends at home with family (and books. 🤣) Well, now it’s my turn for the next 3 days! I plan on doing a heck of a lot of nothing but binging Secrets of the Morgue, Emily in Paris and…you guessed it, reading books! \n\nThis book was a gift from my son and his girlfriend and it came in the most AHMAZING @reesesbookclub box with so many goodies! It was so thoughtful of them and I honestly screamed as I unwrapped it! You never imagine that someday your baby will be buying you presents; it always feels like it should always be the other way around. Anyway, he did GOOD. 😍\n\nWhat’s your favorite celebrity book club?\n~ Mine is definitely Reese’s Book Club!\n\n.\n.\n.\n#luckybook #reesesbookclub #bookclubbox #booksandwine #wineandcurrentlyreading #bookmas #bookclubreads #bookrecommendations #bookcommunity #homelibrary #ilovemyshelf #lastreadsof2021 #readbooksdrinkwine #bookloversofinstagram","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/270169713_443288207247510_1659032409921027945_n.jpg?stp=c0.116.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=fbvlcPjdoX0AX_cBpXC&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD4NuIEFIcROh6IIcnHIZQWsDJHO7Bj2JygStkLasaHlQ&oe=636EC2E6&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Switched out my bedside table #bookstack because this gorgeous bunch of pink and yellow tulips a friend sent were calling out for company.

The prompt this month is READ A BOOK WITH A ONE WORD TITLE, so I thought I would share today my previous #bookface for LUCKY by @marissastapley\nDetails about the challenge and Giveaway is in the pinned post at the top of my page 🤗\n\n💭 Have you ever won the lottery? I have only won small amounts on scratch offs.\n\nSynopsis:\nA thrilling roller-coaster ride about a heist gone terribly wrong, with a plucky protagonist who will win readers' hearts.\n\nWhat if you had the winning ticket that would change your life forever, but you couldn't cash it in?\n\nLucky Armstrong is a tough, talented grifter who has just pulled off a million-dollar heist with her boyfriend, Cary. She's ready to start a brand-new life, with a new identity--when things go sideways. Lucky finds herself alone for the first time, navigating the world without the help of either her father or her boyfriend, the two figures from whom she's learned the art of the scam.\n\nWhen she discovers that a lottery ticket she bought on a whim is worth millions, her elation is tempered by one big problem: cashing in the winning ticket means she'll be arrested for her crimes. She'll go to prison, with no chance to redeem her fortune.\n\nAs Lucky tries to avoid capture and make a future for herself, she must confront her past by reconciling with her father; finding her mother, who abandoned her when she was just a baby; and coming to terms with the man she thought she loved--whose dark past is catching up with her, too.\n\n#bookfacefriday #bookswithonewordtitles #bookfaces #bookfacefridays #readingchallenge #readingchallenge2022 #fictionfriday #fictionaddiction #fridayfiction #luckybook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/302241448_1096300894340826_5969275323686051035_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=AJUvOQ96ONcAX-x4BhM&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAX2lz95Ds6irs4HbZWhcs8sC1Q59n81vYBipiWOp7Fvw&oe=636ECF69&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"🍀BOOK REVIEW 🍀\n\n\"This is a story about a girl named Lucky\"...

I know, I know, I say that a lot, but seriously, it was so good! \n\nThis book goes back between two different time periods, which I love. Lucky’s childhood and the present. \nLucky was raised by her dad, a con artist, but all Lucky wanted was a normal life. \nHer current situation is no less drama. Lucky has pulled off a million dollar heist with her partner and love of her life, but is anyone who they say they really are?!\nThis one tugged at my heart strings some, as Lucky was always wanting to know about her mother who had abandoned her at birth. \nThis story was a great one if you want to read about characters with grit and forgiveness! \n\nThis quote got me! \n“People deserve second chances. And third chances. All people do is make mistakes. If we never forgave, we’d all be alone.”\n\n💭 do you like a book to rotate between time periods or just stick to one? \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#luckybook #lucky #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #bookbythepool #bookbythepoolday #secondchances #mayhopefuls #reading #readingtime","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/280582774_692341388490284_9056170630439714365_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=3qBXoXSH5k4AX_fBqsE&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAgLOIP8mi3D9B4kKnWHztmLEi4GkPltgBHDv1G3JFhTg&oe=636E7F33&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"And they say… SHE’S SO LUCKY. SHE’S A STAR!!! 🍀🎟💸 yep can’t stop singing it. \n\n😎LUCKY by Marissa Stapley 😎\n\nLucky was born into a life of crime. Her dad is one of the best swindlers out there — that is until he wasn’t. And Lucky and her boyfriend just wrapped up a huge complex con — one that Lucky herself didn’t know the extent of. Now she’s on the run on her own and the irony of it all? This wanted criminal also has a winning lotto ticket — but if she tries to cash it, she faces some serious prison time.\n\nI thought this was a perfect palette cleanser when I was between two heavier reads. At just over 200 pages, I breezed through it. And I get why it was picked as a @reesesbookclub pick — it has a bit of a winding tale and you join the likable namesake main character along for the ride. I just really wasn’t impressed with the writing. Everything felt kind of rushed but at the same time it’s not like I was super hooked and wanted more. It was just an easy, solid read I thought was completely fine and what I needed! Really enjoyed how everything ends up (no spoilers 🤭)\n\n#BookInEmojis: 👶🏼⛪️📿🎰🍾🕵🏼‍♀️💰🚍🐕🎟📺🥸🗺🤱🏼🔍🚔👮🏼‍♀️\n\nRead if: Get A Clue was your favorite Disney Channel movie growing up and you love a criminal with a heart of gold story.\n\nWhat’s been a perfect palate cleanser book for you?\n\n#luckybook #reesewitherspoonbookclub #marissastapley #bookreview #bookstagrammers #readstagram #bookishlove #betterwithbooks #coolgirlsread #readingismagic #bookwormlife #whatshouldiread #booksbooksbooks #fortheloveofbooks #alwaysreading #bookstagramfeature #idratherbereading #readersofinstagram #bookrecommendations #bookaholic #bookstagramcommunity","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/272612701_660524081804116_2672427687217406701_n.jpg?stp=c0.84.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=-5y60nOK-tgAX9Pr_L1&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAb4vj5WktieBMHBUfd6c8i6E1iK5Rvzs1DXDj6XqY0Aw&oe=636E193E&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"In their rush to convict Anthony Broadwater for raping a college student in 1981, Syracuse police, prosecutors and judges cut corners.

They live on the rum, change their names and appearance frequently,  and come up against others who are just like them, and then they try to scam each other. The story takes us around the country as Lucky tries to find her biological mother, and also tries to find the way in which to cash in a multi-million dollar lottery ticket, which is harder than one would think, because she is wanted by the law.  Lucky has a good heart, and doesn't want to hurt people, but she can't help herself because it's all she knows.  \n \nIs the ending happy? Some might think so - others not. \nPS: I could see this being made into a TV movie. #luckybook #lucky #lotterytickets #ontherun #fatheranddaughter #scammers #fiction #booksbooksbooks #bookstagram #readersofinstagram #librarybook #framinghampubliclibrary","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/308580930_569450778200421_6043247362273902618_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=JD71jqIB0hkAX-j5xgR&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfARgzNiuJhNKgAmM9QtGRigosDUyKBXaUQ1vxoo1R9QVw&oe=636F4B7B&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Nuestro lector @julianrugna 🇦🇷 quedó 🥈 en la @maderopoker Bounty 30K de ayer, ganando $285K y $70K en concepto de bounties. \n\nGG! 👏🏻 \n\n#lectores #bounty #maderopoker #casinobuenosaires #luckybook #librodelasuerte 🍀","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/307709683_1282777482526554_7436717026076449231_n.jpg?stp=c155.0.470.470a_dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=ECnJ7Di7JlIAX9kG9BL&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCrEcUs1oyoAbPjXTG55K4--a2dfNssnkACEclKwkg6eg&oe=636E7941&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Nuestro lector Nelson @masterpoker33 Scheffer 🇦🇷 quedó 🥈 en el Estrellas De La Patagonia 60K del @casinomagicnqn y obtuvo un premio de $1.1M. \n\nFelicitaciones! 👏🏻 \n\n#lectores #neuquen #casinomagicneuquen #estrellasdelapatagonia #luckybook #librodelasuerte 🍀","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/307567234_463351365555445_3390628309286481167_n.jpg?stp=c155.0.470.470a_dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=cNgwfItzDd4AX8JSzOr&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDASqsYj3wIAkkZx9vHyd2FbhNKk8mbCvZ8E7Tpo468ew&oe=636EA8C1&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Otro título 🏆 de nuestro lector @cristian_rc85 🇦🇷 en el @citycenterros !

O mundo é assim. As coisas que em um momento são tão importantes, em outro já não são. As coisas se desfazem, mas, depois de um tempo, acabam se reconstruindo. Tudo passa.\" 💛\n\nLucky desde muito cedo precisou aprender a dominar algumas artimanhas para conseguir sobreviver e identificar os alvos perfeitos, enganá-los e, por fim, aplicar um calculado golpe de mestre. Após um roubo que lhe garantiu milhões de dólares, está prestes a embarcar em uma vida nova com o namorado, Cary, quando as coisas tomam um rumo completamente diferente do planejado. Agora, distante das emblemáticas figuras tanto do pai quanto do namorado, vai precisar percorrer territórios desconhecidos e recorrer a truques até então inéditos, tudo isso por sua própria conta e risco. É então que, de repente, sua sorte parece virar: um bilhete de loteria comprado por ela em um momento de impulso é o único ganhador de um prêmio multimilionário. Parece a grande solução para todos os seus problemas... se não esbarrasse em um obstáculo – para resgatar o dinheiro, Lucky precisa se identificar. Mas, foragida da polícia e com o rosto estampado em todos os lugares, como pegar a grana sem ir parar na cadeia?\n\nEssa é a premissa de Lucky, uma história instigante com capítulos alternados entre presente e passado. Logo de cara já fiquei envolvida com a narrativa e a escrita da autora. Fora que a personagem Lucky é cativante! A autora faz com que sinta empatia pela personagem logo nas primeiras páginas e muito mais do que falar de uma golpista talentosa, Lucky irá falar sobre segundas chances, sobrevivência e perdão. Foi livro do Clube da Reese Witherspoon e imediatamente já fiquei curiosa com essa história! É um livro que não estava esperando gostar tanto, mas me ganhou completamente! 💛\n\n➡️ JÁ QUERO SABER: TE CONVENCI A DAR UMA CHANCE PARA ESSA HISTÓRIA?
