[{"text":"𝐁𝐮𝐫𝐧 𝐁𝐚𝐛𝐲 𝐁𝐮𝐫𝐧\nby Meg Medina\n\n‘Do I deserve to date someone when there are so many problems I have to deal with?’\n\n𝐒𝐲𝐧𝐨𝐩𝐬𝐢𝐬 \nBurn Baby Burn covers a fictional story of infamous year 1977 in New York. In 1977, there were a freezing winter, a boiling hot summer explodes with arson, a blackout, and a serial killer named Son of Sam, who is shooting young people on the streets seemingly at random.\n\nNora who is seventeen during that time, has to deal not only with city's disaster but also her own trouble, her brother, Hector, is growing more uncontrollable by the day, her mother is helpless to stop him, and her father is so busy with his new family that he only calls on holidays.\n\nAnd it does not stop there, she also has to deal with her own mother who struggles to pay rent and keep defending her brother. There is a cute guy that recently works in the same workplace with her, he is nice, but does she deserve to date with all those problems?\n\n𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐨𝐧\nIt is a slow-paced book, to be honest, it is kind of hard for me to try reading this in the beginning since it was my first time reading a historical fiction and especially there is some dialogues in Spanish that I could not understand, but slowly the story gets interesting and I kind of pity Nora who was treated unfairly by her own mother.\n\nNot really recommended for beginner since it requires a lot of energy to read the few first chapters. But I do recommend this if you love slow-paced story. The emotional feeling I got because of how Nora’s being treated is just so hurtful. Like it’s unfair for her. It frustrates me, how typical people will do to woman in that era.\n\n𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 : 3.75/5 ⭐️","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/238357081_331119948696897_419812796523697652_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=oCXaHtLoY80AX-xrrMB&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDj1bVaJKBBR6D8flviVGQqqFQRcuFvCrUyPeiFWWYFDA&oe=636F323A&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Last chance for free audiobooks! \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#audiobooks #audiobooksync #audiofile #teenbooks #teenreads #teenreader #yabooks #yafiction #kindredbook #octaviaebutler #burnbabyburnbook #megmedina #ownvoices #teenaudiobooks","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/110159434_196394555159202_869516917893772281_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=e4hcfeyLK9kAX8ygcOD&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCCa4sflX9LLf9jmELyxzpp0W8w9rFwi5Rt0ICy1u2fzw&oe=636F9007&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Their new friend, Christina, born deaf, now going blind, but independent and fun! #deafblindfolksonig #cochlearimplants #techiesonig #syracusenyresidents #goodbusservice #publictransportation #lawyers #cornelluniversityalums #americansignlanguageusers #earlycommunication #guidedogs #puppyraisers #tse #gsd #bullterriers #carlourgranddog #dogrescuers #dogfans #booklovers #burnbabyburnbook #writers #diversebooks #ownvoices #publishersweekly #writingcommunity #thosewithdisability #loveoverhate #memorialday","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/61215627_133957201038477_8612483680511995228_n.jpg?stp=c0.135.1080.1080a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=QjTPlpNV5b4AX_m6LYB&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfA6wxNUt_hyWHddudbmm1RDsIpOEfWjnqyOoQoyFVjX3w&oe=636EA2DF&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"The heat is on in this amazing novel by the fantastic Meg Medina!
