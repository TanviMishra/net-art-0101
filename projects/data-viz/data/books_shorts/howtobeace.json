[{"text":"Today marks the beginning of Asexual Awareness Week! And we want to take a moment to remind Ace people that\n\nJust because our store is geared toward sexual pleasure doesn’t mean we are exclusionary towards asexual-identifying people! Every body — including people on the Ace spectrum — can and deserve to experience pleasure and affirmation, especially in non-sexual ways.\n\nWe have books and other resources for people identifying as ace, aromantic, demisexual, gray-asexual, and other identities under the asexual umbrella, as well as educational resources for friends and families wanting to support their ace/aro loved ones.\n\nWe want everyone in our store to feel seen and included, and that includes people who may not feel comfortable coming to stores centered around experiences they don’t engage in as much — or at all!\n\nIf you're not Ace, take some time to educate yourself about the experiences of Ace folks. Think about the ways that allosexuality — or feeling sexual attraction — is centered in our socied ways that you can decenter it in your worldview.\n \nIf you are Ace, celebrate this week however you want! Just know that we see you, we love you, and you're perfect just as you are. Happy #AceAwarenessWeek !\n\n#AceVisibility #Aromanticism #AceUmbrella #AsYouLikeIt #Books #EducateYourself #Inclusivity #LGBTQIAPlus #AsexualAwareness #Demisexuality #GrayAsexual #AsexualPride #AYLI #AshlandOregon #Asexuality #AsexualPride #AroAce #AcePride #AsexualAwareness #AsexualityIsReal #AsexualSpectrum #AceSpectrum #AsexualAndProud #AsexualityAwarnessWeek  #AsexualityResources #Community #LGBTQ #HowToBeAceBook #AIsForAce","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/312426775_2242508302587123_6433911034503814261_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=bHuKkrekBeoAX9oYvJ_&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD6X8bngKEJYhxgtZnhcf8eZ2WJkXA44auczAzDfCx4lg&oe=636B7FC8&_nc_sid=76ac9f"}]
