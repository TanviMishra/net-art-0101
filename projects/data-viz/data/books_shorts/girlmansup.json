I think there's no other way I could or should look.\" \n\nThis quote was about how our MC expresses their gender, and the idea that to be their authentic selves they could only look and dress as they do and I think that will resonate with everyone. How you express yourself is you. You can't really be you on the inside and then dress as someone else on the outsideü§∑ for me the outside changes based on how I'm feeling on the inside on any given day and now I just go with it. \n\nI saw a post by someone (I forget who) saying one day they decided to take a photo and post it as is. No editsüò±. It's about capturing the moment not about editing that moment. In the old days you took a photo and whether it was blurry or otherwise imperfect, it still went in the album because what was important was being there. Also, massive time saver. \n\nNow it's not for everyone (me included, at least not yet) but I like the idea.\n\nIn a world filled with filters and unrealistic expectations, some days it's enough to be able to look in the mirror and say \"I'm alright.\" üòä\n‚òÜ\n#girlmansupbook #fanfriday #bookishlove #quotestoliveby #quoteoftheday #bookstagramza #bookstagram #sabookstagram #sabookstagrammers #sareaders #southafricanreaders  #champrecommends","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/281942482_2195896170577708_3540077551093006069_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=BMkRI8aSC0kAX-Mku7P&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCGWVoqlZoLcWzV1m1tMlEIodaS7PtJf4EY7n16JmNSQQ&oe=636EE328&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"\" when people keep acting like I'm the one who's wrong, it starts to feel they're going to be right no matter how unfair it is.\" üí™üèª‚ñ™Ô∏è #girlmansupbook #feminist #pen #youngadult  #glbt  #canadaüá®üá¶ #prideüåà @harpercollinsca @hccfrenzy @m_e_girard","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/19228193_1947442362206643_564556546067922944_n.jpg?stp=c135.0.810.810a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=3-cmySQAv4gAX-fVMwr&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBHZFMgY1BJbGX-rAhe8-9LbcCYRw9smonA5ARyKnR_vg&oe=636F82E6&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Write Up üßë\n\nüì± Girl Mans Up by M.E Girard \n\nI loved this book (although it didn't start out that way) and I would happily read it again. \n\nThis is the story of Pen(elope) a gender nonconforming teenager who doesn't have the language for how they experience their gender identity and expression. I squealed and laughed and even cried a bit at Pen's experiences in this book. \n\n\"Penelope doesn't really suit you. I like Pencil.\" \n\nThis book is told from Pen's POV with the internal dialogue that goes on while coming of age (they're around 16) and figuring out not only themselves but also crushes and friendships. And they live with the added challenge of immigrant parents who are intent on perpetuating heteronormative stereotypes and just want Pen to be a good girl. \n\nNot all character development in this book is positive. Not all characters are likeable. Sometimes people choose a different path (and I appreciated that truth conveyed in this book). For the most part these are teenagers figuring it out for themselves and who of us haven't needed the grace to make mistakes and be better? \n\nThere a so many important and relevant themes covered including gender identity, gender expression and sexuality and bullying and is a good read. \n\nLike I said, I didnt know how I felt about it in the beginning, and I'm so glad that I stuck with it because none of these characters could have been written in any other way. \n\nDo you like books with unlikeable characters?\n‚òÜ\n#writeup #review #girlmansupbook #bookishlove #bookstagramza #bookstagram #kindle #sabookstagram #sabookstagrammers #sareaders #southafricanreaders  #champrecommends #justbooksbookstagram #lgbtqiaüåà","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/283020672_310902651250549_1427654285615667817_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=rSRLRngFPWUAX_MSOis&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfC2NVbN_gxIwIOqCvyjtUo0v2AkkCg9bk45kNSH-AIcwA&oe=636E1619&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Kids swimming in the light rain while I get my summer reading on. @m_e_girard #hatecolby #girlmansup #girlmansupbook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/19535105_831917113625336_8966324514841427968_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=_1jg0sS9KRQAX9We8Uu&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDTjwos5bPECf5DgA_15-W2Oh9giJrO5tIHJ3PuMP3u2w&oe=636F47FB&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Located at Hidden Beach park in Seascape at the end of Cliff Drive in Aptos.

Some of the characters are so toxic ... but from the beginning:\n\nüá©üá™Deutsche Version  in den Kommentaren\n\nPen is non-binary before the word non-binary existed (at least that's how she feels to me). She is one of the boys even when she doesn't really feel the need to be a boy. She loves video games and her clothes are ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù from her big brother. To say,her parents don't think that's great, woult be an understatement and her mother absolutely doesn't understand why her daughter isn¬¥t the princess she dreamed, but the shame at every family reunion.\n\nIn her circle of friends, Pen is something like the wingman. One of the boys picks a girl and she entangles her in a conversation, making it easier for him to ask her out on a date. It gets really complicated, however, when Pen thinks one of the girls that she is supposed to talk to for her friend is nice ...\n\nWoa, I could identify so well with Pen. This is a relativly rear ocasion for me. I also got really upset about some characters several times, I haven't been that emotionally invested in a story in a long time. It was still not enough to get the 5 stars because the plot was very predictable. It's just a character and not a story-driven book.\n\n4 out of 5 plaid shirts\n\nCN:\n-  homophobia\n- sexual assult\n- sexism\n- toxic familystructures\n- toxic friendship\n\n#girlmansup #girlmansupbook #lgbtlibrary #queerbooks #queerbookstagram #lesbianbook #nonbinarybooks #gaybooks #igreader #bookstagramgermany #igbooks","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/182199938_511789746868814_3938208937299137093_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=stVl6Ho_LGsAX_FHkJa&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBa0w3YMgRqiCm9YZgeMTD-4CWknB0EsxVIkAug9VCfdQ&oe=636F4375&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Our next Pride Book Club for Teens is tomorrow (8/2) at 4pm!

The main character, Pen, struggles with expressing herself as she feels, both in presenting her gender and her sexuality. Facing parents who don‚Äôt understand, a toxic best male friend, and a society who looks at her strangely, her journey of self discovery was an engaging read. Her struggle is unique and a Gordian knot, and I appreciated the singular point of view. Nothing is perfect. I really loved it. ü•ë\nPen is a Sagittarius. She is honest, optimistic yet realistic, and dedicated. Even when her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù (read: TRASH) Colby abuses and harasses her. But she instinctually sticks by the people in her life. She is dedicated to her brother, and despite her frustrations with her family, she is reluctant to completely abandon. Her Sagittarius spirit draws her towards leaps of faith, and in her tumultuous journey of discovering how to be completely herself, she finds opportunities to trust herself and take these leaps. Leading her to the freedom she resolutely craves. ‚õÖÔ∏è\n‚ÄúThe thing is, I‚Äôm not a boy, but I don‚Äôt want to be that girl either. I just want everyone to screw off and let me do my own thing for once.‚Äù\nüïπ\nA Sagittarius‚Äôs secret desire is to create the rules, and Pen struggles under the weight of her uncertainty and society‚Äôs determination for her to define herself. A fire sign, she doesn‚Äôt want to be pushed too far, but she uses her wisdom to make the right choices for her. üî•\nIf you are struggling to identify yourself, don‚Äôt rush. Take your time and find the right timing and opportunity, like Pen, to come out in your own way. It‚Äôs a journey, and you‚Äôre not at the end yet. xx\n‚ôêÔ∏è\n#megirard #girlmansup #girlmansupbook #bookzodiac #astrology #sagittarius #pen #yabooks #lgbtqbooks #lgbtqya #bookstagram #yabookstagram #yabooks #queerya","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/20902734_830321453811141_5079904094403952640_n.jpg?stp=c135.0.809.809a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=xEs22gvzM_UAX-9WACa&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAIOgpNwhWR-vVlTrlUvJCuRSPqiNXLVqpg-ixc2gH5YA&oe=636E84C3&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Pen and Blake‚ù§Ô∏è I haven't seen any fanart for girl mans up so I made some myself. #girlmansupbook #megirard #penandblake #books #queer #lgbtreads","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/20398742_270220326715632_6531339853445988352_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=saqH36Tga_EAX9Z9mG5&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDWcZah177FGNG1ihScRinDapfy-qJ1mXyLz2iVocDOIQ&oe=636FA9AF&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Pen Oliveira from Girl Mans Up!

Amazing LGBTQ+ YA read. But that's not my number 1 point, it's actually number 2. Number 1 is its' discussion of toxic relationships. Wether it is friends/family etc, just a great discussion about the harms. \n2. Pen dresses \"masculine\" which leads to a lot of \"why are you trying to be a boy?\" This is how she feels comfortable, as a straight cis gendered female I related as I was a tomboy growing up. \n3. Pen's internal dialogue. Wow, just wow. Frustrating at times (short temper) to heartbreaking.\n4. A great story, with an amazing reader. I just hope it doesn't get lumped into LGBTQ only read, it has much more to offer.\n\n#girlmansup #girlmansupbook #librarian #teenlibrarian #readersadvisory #yabooks #youngadult #audiobooks #teampen #lgbtqbook #toxicrelationships #books #booktalking","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/16230030_1722112221412794_2026262997843836928_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=NIT-VDEzK5kAX9ifoNx&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfA1tSOcM5gOwEUyTvBtLo_oDQSSTcrX6ObW-TkF_acrxw&oe=636EEF35&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"How many of these CBC best books of 2016 have you read?
