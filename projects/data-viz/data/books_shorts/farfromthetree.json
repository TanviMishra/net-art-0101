Ovo je priƒça o porodici, o razumevanju, o onom neƒçem jedinstvenom i neobja≈°njivom ≈°to nas ve≈æe za na≈°e najbli≈æe.\n.\r\nGrejs ima 16 godina i nedavno se porodila i dala svoju tek roƒëenu bebu na usvajanje. Jedino ko bi je razumeo, i koga ona tek sad razume, jeste njena biolo≈°ka majka koja ju je dala na usvajanje ƒçim se rodila. Grejs odluƒçuje da je potra≈æi, ali prvo saznaje da ima sestru i brata.\n.\r\nNjih troje se upoznaju, zbli≈æavaju i re≈°avaju da naƒëu biolo≈°ku majku. Svo troje prolaze kroz te≈°ke trenutke u ≈æivotu i po prvu put oseƒáaju da nisu sami, da imaju nekog svog na koga se mogu osloniti, iako su do juƒçe bili stranci.\n.\r\nMeni je ova knjiga bila predivna i optimistiƒçna, mada me je na trenutke zaista rastu≈æila. Moram da istaknem dva va≈æna utiska:\n.\r\nPrvo, ova knjiga nas uƒçi o znaƒçaju porodice, koju ni≈°ta ne mo≈æe da zameni. Krv je ne≈°to od ƒçega ne mo≈æemo pobeƒái. ƒåak i kad ne opravdavamo njihove postupke, rodbini uvek moramo biti rame za plakanje.\n.\r\nDrugo je taj ceo proces odvajanja majke od deteta. Knjiga nam doƒçarava ovu temu iz dva ugla: devojke koja je ceo ≈æivot osuƒëivala majku koja ju je napustila, a potom te iste devojke koja napu≈°ta svoje dete. Takoƒëe pratimo porodice svo troje glavnih likova, i kako se oni prilagoƒëavaju usvojenom detetu.\n.\r\nKroz knjigu sam preispitala svoje stavove o porodici i napu≈°tanju/usvajanju dece. Mislim da sam dosta nauƒçila i ostala jo≈° u mislima sa nekim pitanjima na koja valjda i ne postoji odgovor.\n.\nNa kraju, postavlja se pitanje ≈°ta uop≈°te znaƒçi biti porodica? Da li je to krvno srodstvo ili zapravo bilo kakva veza koja nas tera da uvek budemo tu jedni za druge, da se podr≈æavamo i bezrezervno volimo?\n.\nOcena: jaka ƒçetvorka 4+/5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n@robinbenway \n#farfromthetree #farfromthetreebook #robinbenwaybooks #robinbenway #emmyandoliver #citajknjigu #volimknjige #knjigeinstagrama #knjiskimoljac #knjigoljupci #booklover #booknerd #bookstagrambalkan #harperteenbooks @harperteen #readersofinstagram #readmorebooks #readabook #knjigoljubac","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/101666980_2671922973085840_7453287376980184234_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=NDo2MnwfXaMAX_A6ukh&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDecIB1zTRc97WuEwgGXAi_QvtrzxQbqF3oA-o81bgf3Q&oe=636F04FF&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Book 3 of 2022.

Soon enough, they learn that they're all biological siblings and they start a whole new journey to locate their biological mother while trying to find homes in each other on the way.\n.\nThe story kept unwinding, revealing their flaws, vulnerabilities, trust issues, fear of being judged, fear of not being loved and accepted for who they were or being able to love, uncertainties about each of their choices and their consequences, and above all the question tearing at their hearts of what it truly means to be a family.\n.\n It was very, very well-written and the character developments and transitions were striking. The entire \"teen- phase-situation\" was described in a highly frustrating way but was authentic. You'll know why if you read it. There are a lot of diverse elements in the book like teen pregnancy, racism, dysfunctional family, substance abuse, bullying, etc. and I appreciated how the author accomplished to wrap up everything so evenly. \n.\nThe way they explore and open up to each other about their lives, their bond blooming overtime, the flashes and glimpses of affection slowly turning into the fierce, unexplainable love that ties a family together, and the intense feelings which hold one another was exhibited beautifully. I loved itü•∫üò≠. I can't sum it up correctly, there were way too many elements and heart-wrecking emotions, however, with a sense of hope and fulfillment beneath it all. Also omg?

Having grown up the snarky brunette in a house full of chipper redheads, she‚Äôs quick to search for traces of herself among these not-quite-strangers. And when her adopted family‚Äôs long-buried problems begin to explode to the surface, Maya can‚Äôt help but wonder where exactly it is that she belongs.\nAnd Joaquin, their stoic older bio brother, who has no interest in bonding over their shared biological mother. After seventeen years in the foster care system, he‚Äôs learned that there are no heroes, and secrets and fears are best kept close to the vest, where they can‚Äôt hurt anyone but him.\n*\n*\n*\nTags: #yabooks #yabookstagram #yabookstagrammer #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #farfromthetreebook #robinbenway #robinbenwaybooks","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/101166211_155527319345558_6730356482602806896_n.jpg?stp=c0.117.937.937a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=MYuFw1CDciQAX-SE6IK&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfC8N4gfkSnO8Mxp_oRX_bVQr4Khi7KQGdQmDtqvEQAGoA&oe=636E917B&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"How is everyone staying sane in quarantine?\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\nMy picture, please credit if you repost!\n#farfromthetree #robinbenway #bookstagram #books #farfromthetreebook #yabooks #yabookstagram","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/96290710_1318618028339742_4132880793019565032_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=bL8D32miQXkAX_Yest5&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCjne6AwD9yEwzwgsv5hgyOztSU_D1XXZGMus88xPWA9w&oe=636EB553&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"I‚Äôm really loving this wonderful and engaging novel by Robin Benway.
