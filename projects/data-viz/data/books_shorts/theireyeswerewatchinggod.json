[{"text":"An immediate recommendation! If you have not read this book I highly recommend reading it. I read this book in my AP English class when I was in high school and I don‚Äôt think a single person in that class would have criticism on this masterpiece of a book.\n-\nOn a more personal note, I cannot believe it‚Äôs only Tuesday yesterday felt like an entire month. I know I haven‚Äôt been posting so much but I‚Äôve just been busy with life, school, and work but thankfully my summer break is only a 3(?!) weeks away \n.\n.\n.\n\n#bookstagram #books #bookrecommendations #booklover #bookshelf #bookobsessed #bookworm #bookgram #bookaesthetic #bookblog #reading #reader #cozyvibes #readmorebooks #plants #theireyeswerewatchinggod #theireyeswerewatchinggodbook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/279841359_125899356520091_7552659518723439688_n.jpg?stp=c0.142.1137.1137a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=3TYyUhFywJwAX8EP7-C&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCE8Dcq2cwBQLV--CroxdfCXV8OSoJ9Cvs0MdGvN4DEdA&oe=636E77E7&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"üìöüìöüìöüìì\n‚è≥6h 44m\nBeautifully written and a great story teller.

Throughout my life I‚Äôve read excerpts for school and started it and stopped but I read the entire thing and finished last night.\n\nI have thoughts.\n\nZNH‚Äôs writing is phenomenal, as always. She is a master with words and I love how she uses language and Deep South dialect with her characters.\n\nI love how every character is nuanced, deeply flawed and real. This is a simple story but it is human and relatable and lovely.\n\nMy biggest issue with this book is that it sort of devolved into a Jim Crow version of Twilight when Janie met Tea Cake. I know some people might fight be on this but I found Tea Cake and Janie‚Äôs relationship almost distractingly toxic. Janie went from a powerful, outspoken, ambitious woman to a flat, sad, doormat before Tea Cake. And I also sort of thought Tea Cake was the worst too. I just never warmed to him. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI still recommend this book, though. It is REALLY beautiful.","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/121131134_127666558789149_4551174155508669132_n.jpg?stp=c0.49.392.392a_dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=YD3wthLCGLIAX9ptw3m&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfC8vDXJLLG_tNfI1MC0DdO4SwWl4_uBksT7O1Rz1s17aw&oe=636DC0AC&_nc_sid=76ac9f"}]
