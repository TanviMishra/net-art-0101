[{"text":"The Girl Who Fell From the Sky by Heidi W Durrow\n•\nRating: 4/5\n•\nReview: This book is a quick read, but the content of it hits hard and deep. At first, we don’t know much about Rachel and her story. As the book goes on however, we learn more and more about her story in bits and pieces. Each new detail made my heart break even more for Rachel, as the new things that were slowly revealed were even more devastating than the last. By the end, I felt for Rachel and just wanted to bundle her up in a hug and tell her everything would be okay. Durrow does an amazing job with her character development, helping the characters come to life in very believable, lifelike ways. I truly felt immersed in the story and really enjoyed it.","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/294227798_580998173392308_4922528376069630350_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=Xee8qxAIxM4AX8s7gcd&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBHC83ePpUMbUmBcNpKpaEXKGPlCJvfOMKhAxIjAUgojg&oe=636F61E3&_nc_sid=76ac9f"}]
