Galgon\n☁️ Genre: Action 💥 Thriller 🔪\n☁️ My Rating: 💎💎💎💎💎\n\n💬 My Thoughts\n\nExcuse me while I pick my jaw up off the floor... This book is INCREDIBLE.  Dare I say, this might be one of my new all time favorite books.\n\nI was contacted by the author for a review copy a couple weeks after coming across his book and adding it to my \"want to read\" list so I was super excited to receive a copy.  As soon I got it, I pushed it to the top of my TBR and ended up finishing it in about 6 hours.  When I say I couldn't put this book down, I mean I stayed up late on a work night reading and then woke up early before work to read some more.  I will now be making my husband read this next.\n\nThe suspense in this writing is unmatched.  The story is genius.  The fast pace of the book is absolutely perfect.  I will be recommending this one to literally anyone that will listen and I cannot wait for some of my booksta friends to get their hands on a copy.\n\nIf you like thrillers, action, suspense, secret societies 🤫🤭, then this is one of your future favorites right here.\n\nThank you SO much, Stephen, for sending me this book.  I will probably be re-reading it at least once a year 😂\n\n#TheCircleIsReal #TheCircleBook @TheCircleIsReal\n\n..\nQOTD:  Tell me about a book that totally blew your mind?! 🗣","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/235557742_551317642846492_3270419291859045854_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=D0qDQCgHC3UAX86Lr1E&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAL-eSrRGTLkJvWheSFkkuGc3oG-fmlCbjhSCZy1jAFOw&oe=636F5EC7&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"THE CIRCLE by Stephen J. Galgon ⭕️ \n\nThank you to the author @thecircleisreal for the gifted review copy!\n\n💭 What would you do for all the money and power in the world?\n\nDoug Goodwin lived an average life until he was recruited to join The Circle, a secret society whose members hunt each other for sport. \n\nI branched out of my comfort zone with the action thriller. The story was fast-paced and exciting, and I was horrified by the moral dilemmas. This book offers some interesting social commentary on the rich, elite echelons of society. The premise is just wild enough to seem plausible.\n\nHowever, I think this genre is ultimately not for me. Character depth and development often took a backseat to the action and conspiracy. If you’re a fan of action movies, I think you’ll enjoy this book!\n\n…\n#thecirclebook #thecircleisreal #stephenjgalgon #thrillerbook #thrillerbooks #actionthriller #indiebook #bookreview #bookreviewer #mjepublishing","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/275846989_1109551699883449_632627174455987003_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=Mmg6-MKOVDkAX-u3mEG&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDWPSVmpOBBQkhvztjvMelZtGfrSeazXEe0HaVlT4OKfA&oe=636F00FC&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Happy Weekend Everyone! 🎃✨\n\nI hope everyone is having a magical weekend so far, wherever in the wide world you happen to be.\n\nThis bookstack was a lot of fun to make but it is all over the place.
