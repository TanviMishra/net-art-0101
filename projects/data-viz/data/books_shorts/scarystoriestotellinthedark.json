[{"text":"Most scary stories are, of course, meant to be told. They are more scary that way.

It's Halloween in Mill Valley, and Stella and her friends - Ramon, Chuck and Auggie - decide to explore the Bellows mansion, a supposedly haunted place with a dark past. As they return to their homes, Stella brings back an old story-book from the mansion with her. Soon strange things start happening and people start to disappear. ⁣\n⁣\n👍What works: ⁣\n⁣\n- Each of the stories is straight out of your darkest nightmares and would leave a visual mark on your psyché. Guillermo del Toro's signature craft in the creation of monsters is clearly visible. Think of Pan's Labyrinth. ⁣\n⁣\n- The camaraderie of the four teenagers is believable, and almost reminds you of the gang from Stranger Things. ⁣\n⁣\n- The fast-paced screenplay with an authentic 60s vibe in the backdrop of the Vietnam war provides an interesting mood to the tone. ⁣\n⁣\n👎What doesn't work: ⁣\n⁣\n- The narrative is bogged down by a clichéd premise that has been seen many times in the horror genre. ⁣\n⁣\n- Some of the plot elements feel unnecessary and go on to add nothing to the overall narrative. ⁣\n⁣\n🗣️Verdict: This could have been a gripping limited series. The movie, however, leaves you wanting for depth. ⁣\n⁣\nIn association with @indiafilmproject .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#scarystoriestotellinthedark #scarystoriestotellinthedarkmovie #scarystoriestotellinthedarkfilm #scarystoriestotellinthedarkmovieposter #scarystoriestotellinthedarktrilogy #scarystoriestotellinthedark2019 #scarystoriestotellinthedark📖 #scarystoriestotellinthedarkseries #scarystoriestotellinthedarkcollection #scarystoriestotellinthedarkbook #scarystoriestotellinthedarkposter #scarystoriestotellinthedarkfanart #scarystoriestotellinthedarkadaptation #scarystoriestotellinthedarkinfluenced #scarystoriestotellinthedarkedits #scarystoriestotellinthedarkposters #scarystoriestotellinthedarkforever #horror #scarystories #guillermodeltoro #halloween #instahorror #horrormovies #horroraddict #horrormovie #horrorfan #harold #creepy #scarystoriesmovie","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/66796424_530774917659049_5721944463223895412_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=x7K4if2NPIYAX8FaCcf&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDXS2G9G3L61icCnPcvD923SoBg2tDUoA7ojQaBkzckSA&oe=636EA383&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Went to Chapters and got my hands on the hardcover collection of the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark trilogy, with all the original artwork too! \nFunny thing, as much as I loved spooky things and horror, I never actually read these books when I was a kid. I remember them being so damn popular though - the kids in my school were always taking them out of the library. For me though, while the stories seemed creepy and scary, it was the illustrations that truly disturbed me. The covers alone made me nope out, so I never read them. And while the illustrations still do creep me the fuck out, I have a mad respect for the unique art style and how the illustrations make the stories all the more scary. The original artwork is DEFINITELY the reason why these were so popular back then.\n\nThe movie, by the way, was quite good. The acting was decent, the scares were great. I thought it would be a perfect little \"gateway\" horror movie for any kids wanting to get into horror. There were two scenes in particular that really creeped me the fuck out.

Four teenagers are involved in a hit and run and kill a man. That’s pretty much where the similarities end. In the book, instead of a fisherman, the teens strike and kill a biker. The major difference, though, is the movie is basically a slasher flick and the book is most definitely not. In the movie, the four teens are haunted by the fisherman, who did not die in the accident, and who stalks and attacks them with his hook for a hand.\n\n#scarystoriestotellinthedark #scarystoriestotellinthedarkmovie #scarystoriestotellinthedarkedit #scarystoriestotellinthedarktattoo #scarystoriestotellinthedarkfilm #scarystoriestotellinthedarkmovieposter #scarystoriestotellinthedarktrailer #scarystoriestotellinthedarktrilogy #scarystoriestotellinthedark3 #scarystoriestotellinthedarkteasertrailer #scarystoriestotellinthedark2019 #scarystoriestotellinthedarkinspired #scarystoriestotellinthedark📖 #scarystoriestotellinthedarkedits #scarystoriestotellinthedarkcollection #scarystoriestotellinthedarkbook #scarystoriestotellinthedarkdrawing #scarystoriestotellinthedarkmoviereview #scarystoriestotellinthedarkseries #scarystoriestotellinthedarkfanart #scarystoriestotellinthedarkteaser #scarystoriestotellinthedarktreasury #scarystoriestotellinthedarkadaptation #scarystoriestotellinthedarkinfluenced #scarystoriestotellinthedarkmovienight #scarystoriestotellinthedarkreview #scarystoriestotellinthedarkposter #scarystoriestotellinthedarkdocumentary #scarystoriestotellinthedarkrp #scarystoriestotellinthedarkmoviereviewintamil","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/67087115_405137380208182_3200830375617133659_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=9-hRmgk8Zm8AX9ZdW0J&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDQw3wIN9qcZcS6bZsAOtQ6Lye4JxgObIIATd3Go7c4tw&oe=636E7517&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark was released last week in the U.S. to positive reviews, and is based on the children's book series of the same name, about a group of teens face their fears in order to save their lives.

Instead of the ghosts driving him insane, as in the book, the film version is already insane and the hauntings push him over the edge. The book helped solidify Stephen King as the premiere horror novelist of his generation and is now on the Mt.

In the book, he is immediately scummier and more obviously scary than in the movie. In the novel, Bates is also a slovenly drunk who immediately makes readers wary of him, whereas in the movie, he is presented as somewhat clean cut and normal before being revealed as the killer. This changes the nature of the terror in the book. It works very effectively, scaring readers with his potential and allowing imaginations to run wild, as a book should do.\n\n#scarystoriestotellinthedark #scarystoriestotellinthedarkmovie #scarystoriestotellinthedarkedit #scarystoriestotellinthedarktattoo #scarystoriestotellinthedarkfilm #scarystoriestotellinthedarkmovieposter #scarystoriestotellinthedarktrailer #scarystoriestotellinthedarktrilogy #scarystoriestotellinthedark3 #scarystoriestotellinthedarkteasertrailer #scarystoriestotellinthedark2019 #scarystoriestotellinthedarkinspired #scarystoriestotellinthedark📖 #scarystoriestotellinthedarkedits #scarystoriestotellinthedarkcollection #scarystoriestotellinthedarkbook #scarystoriestotellinthedarkdrawing #scarystoriestotellinthedarkmoviereview #scarystoriestotellinthedarkseries #scarystoriestotellinthedarkfanart #scarystoriestotellinthedarkteaser #scarystoriestotellinthedarktreasury #scarystoriestotellinthedarkadaptation #scarystoriestotellinthedarkinfluenced #scarystoriestotellinthedarkmovienight #scarystoriestotellinthedarkreview #scarystoriestotellinthedarkposter #scarystoriestotellinthedarkdocumentary #scarystoriestotellinthedarkrp #scarystoriestotellinthedarkmoviereviewintamil","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/68931963_181576269530247_8918071436318890626_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=nGUeXKYL3VEAX-gX7if&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBlOyFZ5-zBFGbJMwke1v6xQmd-KpqDf_vWdccrq6eMsQ&oe=636DDE4B&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark was released last week in the U.S. to positive reviews, and is based on the children's book series of the same name, about a group of teens face their fears in order to save their lives.
