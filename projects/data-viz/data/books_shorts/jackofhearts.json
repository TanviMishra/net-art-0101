In order of obsessiveness.\n.\n1. Almost the entire novel is set in my adorable small town: Stillwater, Minnesota, USA.\n2. Most of the events occur over three years...1988-1991.\n3. I started writing the novel as backstory for a TV series I wrote first. Then it took on a life of its own and became a 500+ page behemoth. 🤷🏼‍♀️\n4. I wrote the bulk of that massive manuscript in 3 months. No joke. Since then, I have been tweaking, fine-tuning, having it read, editing, and engaging in general foot dragging.\n5. I listened to 80's / 90's pop songs while writing to get in the spirit of the book.\n6. I have detailed timelines for each character, including things like their birthdays, first days of school, proms...and other secrets.\n7. I drew up floor plans of all the significant characters' houses and exhaustively searched online images for similar houses and rooms.\n8. The characters go to the \"old\" high school (now junior high) which was the location of the high school at that point in real-life history. I interviewed several former students of the school. I changed the name of the school, though, so I can create my own story for the school's future... and issue my own fake diplomas. 😆\n9. I used historical daily temperature and weather records throughout the process of writing the novel so that the weather in the novel is historically accurate.\n10. I may actually now own most of the significant furniture, costumes, and accessories mentioned in the book. I will leave you to imagine why... 😎\n.\n.\n.\n#jackofheartsbook #aprilsauntryjames #februarywriterswipchallenge #februarywriterswipchallenge2022 #tenfactsaboutmywip #WIP #amwriting","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/272803685_129822852865838_5020948832129628934_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=ooqWUBBtOtoAX8xNdQj&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAv0xTWXkIyizHCCfPnm00ZvEs5TDzvgVs4e4ZgIdtzeQ&oe=636DF3BC&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Fantastic book launch for JACK OF HEARTS (AND OTHER PARTS) by L.C.

It kept me so enthralled that i binge read it in a day because i was so addicted to the story and its characters. Whilst simultaneously being a mystery, it is open, honest, and oddly educational ! We get a confident character who knows who he is, and wants to help others feel the same, and being pushed into a box shows the effects on him heavily.\nThe story itself is fast paced and exciting, with a mix of drama, friendships, and sex, it felt almost real !\nSpeaking of sex, our world is usually divided into those who despise even the word and those who are open, and this book normalises the heck of sex and that’s so important for readers to learn today !\nOverall i cannot wait for this book to be released for you all, so you can experience this amazing story also !\nAnd thank you for @littlebrownyoungreaders for the copy !\n•\n•\n•\n#Bookstagram #book #bookworm #bookclub #booknerd #bookshelf #bookish #bookmark #booklove #bookaddict #bookaholic #bookphotography #booklover #bookblogger #book #read #reading #tumblr #aesthetic #jackofheartsbook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/44406955_498713180629032_8928410497859857189_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=EljDcKZ1GAMAX_bFq7P&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfB1YvcJRBeb7mVDv0z8cGV0Wcc646CLozogKofW18_FxQ&oe=636F0F62&_nc_sid=76ac9f"}]
