[{"text":"How I picture Riley from Symptoms of Being Human\nFound this book from a classmate who did their book report on it, and I’m not totally done with the book yet, but it’s one of the best I’ve read in a long time, and it’s one of only a couple books that I’ve read that accurately represent genderqueer people! (by the way, if you have any good titles with genderqueer protagonists, please share.) Definitely read it if it sounds like something you are into. (Also, I know, it depicts Riley’s hair on the cover, and that is not what I drew, but I like long hair Riley, so deal with it)\n\n#symptomsofbeinghuman #symptomsofbeinghumanfanart #symptomsofbeinghumanbook #rileycavanaugh #art #artist #artistsoninstagram #artwork #digitalart #digitalartist #digitaldrawing #digitalartwork #genderfluid #genderfluidart #genderfluidpride #genderfluidcharacter","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/284466378_126716723361575_1812490926365540916_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=IQmFCEC5eZgAX_vS3zi&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfClns8ufIrSkdetMxqidTJq8C0w7ZtyxKOOIQDREy2DFA&oe=636E4DD9&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"#bibliophile #bookstagram #book #books #symptomsofbeinghuman #symptomsofbeinghumanbook #symptomsofbeinghumanjeffgarvin","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/53192822_2129839613763938_4214964547108003538_n.jpg?stp=c135.0.809.809a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=DHnyKQuSIzMAX_hHpbt&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDvpeUD8GoiLadZAPpwCdrKF0NKGbRDDEWUKSl4xuYb8w&oe=636F2131&_nc_sid=76ac9f"}]
