[{"text":"Girl, woman, other! Reveiw. \nRating: ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ\n*I realy enjoyed this but it was a bit tricky to read: throughout the entire novel there was non full stops and the language/themes was definitly mature. It was a great insight into the lives of black woman, throughout different generations and of different sexual identities. I enjoyed the perspective slightly more with some characters and my fav sections were latisha and megan/morgan. It was so clever how all the lives intersect. \nWould recomend! \n\n#girlwomanother #girlwomanotherbook #books \n#bookstagram","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/260246017_117537917402214_1370300797891911933_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=JIsc3rA0vxsAX_uVCqL&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAYyue2GzE8YNxCHHCJlYvF3rCx2-WNxrWYcHJMBCwqEQ&oe=636DDC52&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Hi hi hi lovelies! üòò \n\nI don‚Äôt really have a title for this list cause it‚Äôs more of a pandering, floopy conversation type post!\n\nDo you guys ever buy a book but then never really want to read it?

It was a quick read with short chapters, and I really got lost in the Alaskan scenery. There could have been more character development for sure as some parts felt rushed but overall I thought it was a fun, quick read.\n\nüë©üèæ‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®üèºüè° Act Your Age, Eve Brown by Talia Hibbert- I absolutely loved this book! It‚Äôs the third in the Brown Sisters trilogy, and it did not disappoint. All the characters were great, and I felt were all developed really well. This was my favorite book of the three for sure.\n\n‚õ≤Ô∏èü§´ The Fountains of Silence by Ruta Sepetys- This is an author that does not waste a word. AFOS was slower paced than some of her other books, but I honestly didn‚Äôt mind it. There were so many perspectives, and such a detailed and rich history of Spain during the dictatorship of Franco. Highly recommend for any historical fiction readers.\n\nüëßüèæüåå Amari and the Night Brothers by B.B. Alston- This was so fun! I started it on a whim after reading some heavier books and it was the right move. The characters are great, the plot is great, the twists and turns are also great, and honestly I forgot this was a middle grade book. Looking forward to Book 2!\n\nüëßüèæüë©üèæ Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo- I loved the style of this. It contained many interconnected stories based on a single character, who would have appeared in other chapters. I personally like this as it adds a new dimension to the stories being told. There is a bit of a non-traditional writing style, but it works to keep the reader‚Äôs attention. That being said, it is slow-paced and reflective, and I found myself putting it down and picking it up over the three weeks that I read it. \n\nüåÉüîç City of Glass by Cassandra Clare (reread)- I have way more questions than I do answers. All I need to say is Clary just needs to stop making out with people that could *potentially* be her brothers.\n\nHave you read any of these?","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/277035467_495464048730897_5888108382006533925_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=pYUWjvBfXwQAX9dLjBO&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDneJE58UeGWoDmPhosPzDJUuZZgVhirpaRle72U8SBOA&oe=636ED5F2&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"-girl, woman, other by Bernardine Evaristo-\n\nwow what can i say about this book that has not already been said. i found it really amazing, informative and compelling! i love the books that follow characters through their whole life, and this one follows 12 women with different sexualities, racial backgrounds and generations.  the writing style can be a bit hard to get into because of the sentence formation. sometimes it reads like poetry and/or non-fiction but i personally really liked it. all the narratives were very interesting and i found myself immersed in this book throughout. \n\nwhat did you think of it if you've read it?","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/153018913_280100517053386_956615152133237615_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=itsj0P_tKnEAX-xVb0z&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBtfII3noinRLyJ0So9WLmoRsX_9kenSVGBA9MCJ7jhqQ&oe=636EA7FE&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Hello #instateaders üìñ..\nWhat‚Äôs up !

This booker prize winner ticks a lot of boxes in terms of what fiction of modern age should be like . Don‚Äôt we all really crave for books where LBBTQ is no more a genre and women are ambitious not just in non fictions, where caste and race is a topic but only in the background . I feel books like these is the need of the day. \n\nThis book is a story of 12 characters , mostly women , black and British . I found it very modern because of the fact that it does not marginalise Gays and lesbians to only sexual desires and does not limit women to their issues of being a female. It goes beyond that , it highlights their life , as humans , with careers, struggles, achievements, aspirations and desires and so much more . \nAll the characters are strong and flawed in their own unique ways .They are so brilliantly portrayed that I became a part part of each story and I loved that about the book . Every character was far from cliched portrayals and absolutely charming because of their originality.I felt I needed so much more of each character , I was kind of left craving for more every time a chapter ended.I adored how stories seeped into each other just enough to weave everything together. \n\nThe writing style is being loved by so many and I absolutely get it . It made it so much easier to read as if it was flowing but I am a big sucker for beautifully written prose, well articulated sentences and carefully chosen words ,so I was not such a big fan . Although it dint bother me at all after first few pages. \n\nOverall , I feel this is a must read for everybody, it might change your perspective on a lot many aspects of society as it did for me .","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/119779000_179748700347378_5424233216024022661_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=iPeqH6m8B80AX-0miF3&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDx_gHPmAJBzgOYibySsbT_6_lvmegVA3l1Qb73_JS-Ew&oe=636E0203&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"What's your next read?\n#girlwomanother #girlwomanotherbernadineevaristo #girlwomanotherbernardineevaristo #girlwomanotherbook #bernadineevaristo #bookstagrammer #bookstagram #booksofinstagram #fictionbooks #contemporaryfiction #amreadingcontemporary #ireadcontemporary #contemporarybooks #youngadultcontemporary #ireadyoungadultbooks #ireadyabooks #bookstacks #booksbooksbooks #booksandflowers #booksandcake #ireadfiction #ireadwithmydog #ireadyalit #bookerprize #newbooks #amreadingfiction","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/119467508_656436501949983_6465186337546286989_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=D1sZogIKSVMAX-alOqK&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDbmVOuJloKBEwoAEz2wm-rHqA_5L2Vhgz-8IINnOukQQ&oe=636DFCCE&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"The book ‚ÄòGirl, Woman, Other‚Äô by Bernardine Everisto on a grey woven blanket with orange fabric behind the top left corner and bottom right corner of the book.","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/118768300_194478875356194_3465799106910368723_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=LB2DtyuIz5MAX_8eKkV&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBlS1_F_k0ya7lM4gOgUudeP9eyXhFxI5FrTB0g6EMrJw&oe=636DEC95&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"... excited to get into these, at some point ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #somanybookssolittletime ...\nŸ†\n‚ñ∏ Read any of these yet?

It is about 12 different characters and how they lives subsequently intertwine.

I gave it a chance last year when I read ‚ÄúQueenie‚Äù, but I was totally disappointed. Queenie is a book that although written by a black woman, it was intended for a different audience. I was skeptical of giving this book a chance due to the fear of it committing the same fallacy but I was wrong.\n:\n\nGirl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo follows 12(11+ 1 non-binary) British black women whose narratives are interwoven. This collection of stories is rich and represents the complexities of being a black woman. The best part of this book is how fully fledged each one of these characters is. Every one of their stories could stand alone and be it‚Äôs own book. I connected with each of these entities despite the flaws that many of them possessed. I rated this book a 5/5 because it was truly a masterpiece and totally deserving of the Booker Prize last year. :\n\nIf you enjoyed ‚ÄúHomegoing,‚Äù you‚Äôll truly love these intergenerational personal stories that tackle important issues such as racism, sexism, sexuality, classicism, gender identity, etc. Have you read this book?
