[{"text":"It's one from the YA catergory for #rainbowreads this week! Introducing...\n\n‚ú® LILY AND DUNKIN ‚ú®\n\nA fantastic novel that seamlessly blends issues faced by transgender children and those who live with mental illness. Donna Gephart sensitively handles their choices and shows realistic consequences, holding nothing back when it comes to what it takes to be seen, and loved, for who you really are. Donna wrote Dunkin's character for her son, who also suffers from bipolar disorder to provide better representation for youth with mental illnesses. She has been praised by many for the represenation she displays in her story. üìö \n\n#rainbowfamily #rainbowfamilies #lgbt #lgbtqia #lgbtquiaplus #gayfamily #gaydad #gaymum #lesbian #gay #equality #pride #queer #queerparentsconnect #transparent #community #equalrights #happy #love #family #australia #sydney #lilyanddunkin #lilyanddunkinbook #author #donnagephart #lgbtbooks #lgbtresources","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/125244439_445425769805139_5432605399650443787_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=El4Q5AFyMNcAX8FWRX_&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAwyJWhxLdXz2lM49_612CGHAfWBvxwTUqmn1t_Xc7DHw&oe=636F097C&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"‚ÄúLily and Dunkin‚Äù by Donna Gephart is a book about Lily Jo McGrother, born Timothy McGrother, who is a transgender girl, and Dunkin Dorfman or Norbert Dorfman, who is a boy dealing with bipolar disorder and has just moved to Lily‚Äôs town. But when the two meet, their lives will change forever.\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\nI heard so many amazing things about this book when I first picked it up, the story sounded very wholesome to me so I knew I was going to enjoy it! Lily and Dunkin both seemed like such sweet characters, but I felt that they were apart for almost the entire book. I wished they could‚Äôve spent more time together, they both seemed like really good friends toward each other and I felt the two had really good chemistry. However I also read that the way bipolar disorder was portrayed in this book was very much inaccurate, and that can be very harmful because it will only further stigmatize bipolar disorder. So please be aware of this if you‚Äôre interested in this book. On a lighter note,  I do suggest picking this one up for those who want a more light and wholesome story to read, overall it‚Äôs 3/5 stars for me! üòäüòä\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n#lilyanddunkin #lilyanddunkinbook #book #bookreviews #bookstagrammer #booknerd #bookishcoven #books #bookaddict #bookreviewers #bookishaesthetic #booksbooksbooks #bookworm #bookish #bookshelf #kindle #kindleunlimited #kindlereads #kindlebook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/118138899_220695192705397_4137983173536996444_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=5bPB6uzKNJkAX-_H1Da&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBPvYIep_vO9F_3Wt-HIi-X5jQ4nnabAchJfkNs_iJEVw&oe=636F3494&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Let the world see you. #middlegradebooks #transgenderawareness #mentalhealthawareness #sundayfunday #schoollibrarian #librariansofinstagram #teachersofinstagram #bookstagram #lilyanddunkinbook #donnagephart","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/133097791_238428640996083_3725959322857397946_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=Sf-hGclSWUgAX-kmFsn&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCo3z0xR36fUTLx0pOvLfLDeRurCxnzSE9jKPgGhvvBcg&oe=636DCD4D&_nc_sid=76ac9f"}]
