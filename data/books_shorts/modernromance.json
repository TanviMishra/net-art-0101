And the ending was one for the ages!!!\n\nHere‚Äôs a brief synopsis:\n\nThirty-five-year-old Ursula Byrne, VP of Strategic Audacity at a branding agency in Manhattan, is successful, witty, whip-smart, and single. She‚Äôs tried all the dating apps, and let‚Äôs just say: she‚Äôs underwhelmed by her options.

The price tag is high, the promise ambitious‚Äì‚Äìa level of lifelong compatibility that would otherwise be unattainable. In other words, The Arc will find your ideal mate.\n\nOut on 2/8/22!!!\n\nThank you to @stmartinspress and @netgalley for the advanced copy.","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/272945934_114943874278933_1599043037344667260_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=5N1bV0cKM8oAX_4Yu99&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAkexzSsc_X5lbwFRK80Ytv1_Atxf_wnEs9B1VTqd-o2g&oe=636F1B3D&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Chapter 13 of \"Vivid Wings\"  is Out Now üî•\n\nAvailable on Booknet. \n\nüñ§Double Tap if you like to read Contemporary Romance And Inspiration Romanceüñ§ \n\nWhat is your Preferred Genre?\n\nüñ§\nüñ§\nüñ§\n#romance #novels #urbanstrories #fiction #fictionbooks #contemporaryromance #inspirationromance\n#arrogantman #friendlywoman #loveatfirstsight #brothersfriend #billionaire #feistyfemalelead #books #desires #lovestoriesnovels #passion #instafeed #trendingmusic #hotalphamale #attractivefemalelead #attractions#booknet #sansuality #modernromancebook #bookstagram","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/299924910_1010435092925396_6574568595474493467_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=QyycpGsFTtEAX8nakF0&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCE2OWr-UkdUbxGb-1EcvhqkuAbJbb0v24DX8Pc-Xy0tQ&oe=636E8879&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"I am extremely bad at relationships. In my almost 20 year of grown up life, I have managed to spend a staggering 4 year in something you could kind of call a relationship.\n\nAnd don‚Äôt get me started on finding romance while being a mostly introverted, but at the same time very outspoken book nerd with social anxiety in her thirties. \n\nSo I was intrigued when I spotted this book in a second hand store. I mean comedians are not exactly known to be the romantic types and well, bad relationships make for great comedy. So I was hoping to maybe learn a bit and have some laughs.\n\nAnd I have to say, my expectations where shattered. The book was funny, quite informative and well written. And also just pretty. As I am not exactly the shiny social butterfly type, that can meet people everywhere, I have been on dating apps for a while now and so reading about other peoples struggles with them and a lot of interesting facts and statistics, was kind of calming and encouraging.\n\nAlso learning about the dating culture in other countries was eye opening. I guess we are quite happy here in Estonia that we don‚Äôt have such strong stereotypes, like the herbivore men of Tokyo and the very carnivorous no-is-just-a-prelude-for-yes men in Buenos Aires.\n\nIf there is only one thing to take away from this book, it‚Äôs that we don‚Äôt live in a mystical world where your other perfect half is out there somewhere. You got to give people a chance and put work into getting to know someone and building a relationship that lasts.\n\nModern Romance by Aziz Ansari and Eric Klinenberg\nPulblished in 2015\n\nBtw, I also loved that the book had a price tag from a second hand bookstore on it, which means, I am at least its third owner.
