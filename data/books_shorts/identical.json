Ellen Hopkins was/is one of my all time favorite authors when I read her first book Crank and as many of her other books I could get my hands on. But once I read this book I was taken back. This is one of those dark and scary stories of what happens behind close doors and what teenagers are feeling when they are feeling lost and looking for their way out of a dark hole. I did not have the easiest or fun high school experience and I could relate to these girls very easily, but with the huge twist at the end it makes the story spin everything in your head. Also, Ellen Hopkins writes this story in poem format rather than a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù story layout. I do not recommend young kids or teens to read any of her books for their are very adult, but I do recommend older teens and young adults to read at least one of her books because they will change your life forever. \n.\n.\n#ellenhopkins #identicalbook #teenage #feelinglost #triggers #lifechanging #oneofmyfavorites","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/118174579_654639095408750_7865191305740854481_n.jpg?stp=c0.136.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=CP12mibTxn4AX8mv739&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBgVL1jjDD0IWxkL_X1IvsPhnZstNE0QubkqrC5mWiTvg&oe=636DEB86&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Please tell me what you think in comments below‚¨áÔ∏è\nBased on @ellenhopkinsauthor ‚ÄúIdentical‚Äù\nIf you repost, please give credit to me.üòÅ\nPc: Meüòú\n\n#identicaltwins #identicalbook #ellenhopkins #poetry #morbidpoetry #books #yabooks #justanotherbook ##justanotherpoem #photography","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/64903910_2453602534922414_1049395265656958307_n.jpg?stp=c155.0.420.420a_dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=8djMohBUhvkAX8H0Op_&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfB67pi9DfwYwWNWYQxqi3w1j2k7g3PvgzUvjU_ndzlxoQ&oe=636F1512&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"I have set a new goal for myself and that is to read at least 18 books by @ellenhopkinsauthor .
