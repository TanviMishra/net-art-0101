In between, comes the life of the agent and life of the terrorist as well. It‚Äôs more of chasing rather than mystery. It is the whole journey of the agent of figuring out not only the terrorist but also his life. Basically there are five important events that is bound strangely by a subtle thread, which gets unraveled by the agent. \nMY REVIEW:\nPace- The pace was fast. Not too much though. As mentioned there are many events happening but the author didn‚Äôt write it in a complex way. It was easy to catch up and remember.\nLanguage- The narration was perfectly lucid. The author mentioned some political aspects but those were too in a non-complicated way. \nPlot- The plot was intriguing and building from the very first chapter. It was not monotonous for a single moment. \nThe plot writing was a little similar to Dan Brown‚Äôs. Just a little. However, it was an easy read unlike the complexity of Brown‚Äôs. \nCharacter development- In between all the chaos of solving murder, terrorism attack stress, the author explained the life of the protagonist and also the terrorist. However, I felt like, it was this constant rivalry between Americans and the Muslims. \nClimax- The climax did give a closure. However, it ended in such a way that if the author wants, he can write a sequel. \nI give this 4 stars because I was not bored for a moment, the book caught my attention from first to last and not for a moment I thought to DNF it. \nFROM: @crescent_books.bd\nYou may check my more detailed review in goodreads.\n\n#reviewtales #saikareviews \n\n#iampilgrim #terryhayes #bookstagrambdüáßüá© #bookishpost #readersthoughts #readersreview #bdbookblogger #bengaliblogger #bengalireaders #booktography #bookstagrambd #readerreads #heavybook #heavythriller #iampilgrimbook #bookreview #books","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/233794590_3799142786852888_1203359599716944575_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=JV2F_yOfe40AX8ycPrw&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD9FP5I2X6jzwf8CEBKN0lzxWpJnulYJwTHEdzkRZoNkg&oe=636DCD43&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"HARD COVER\n‚Äúyou can‚Äôt read a book by its cover‚Äù üìï \n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\ncolored pencil on wood \nüìö Would love to see any other ideas for a title.\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n#coloredpencildrawing #coloredpencilart #bookart #bookarts #hardcover #hardcoverbooks #handdrawn #plaiddecor #plaid #hardcoverbook #drawingonwood #woodart #popularstory #heavybook #hardlyread #makeupthestory \n#femaleartist #artworkoninstagram #instaart #instaartist #instaartwork #contemporaryart #contemporaryartist #emergingartist #emergingartists #artfun #funart #madefromfoundobjects #foundobject","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/238899977_331181691966186_6211150838130637247_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=ePtq55F-vd0AX9ijW2p&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAO5jZH_l2-hlQQXAmYmrOwO3y7v0yki-xuCwxD8yxcRA&oe=636B29CD&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"The days of 'coffee table' books are back.

There is a new sense of optimism and purpose in the town, embodied in the impressive new ice rink that has been built down by the lake.\n\nTwo years have passed since the events that no one wants to think about. Everyone has tried to move on, but there‚Äôs something about this place that prevents it. The destruction caused by a ferocious late-summer storm reignites the old rivalry between Beartown and the neighboring town of Hed, a rivalry which has always been fought through their ice hockey teams.\n\nMaya‚Äôs parents, Peter and Kira, are caught up in an investigation of the hockey club‚Äôs murky finances, and Amat‚Äîonce the star of the Beartown team‚Äîhas lost his way after an injury and a failed attempt to get drafted into the NHL. Simmering tensions between the two towns turn into acts of intimidation and then violence. All the while, a fourteen-year-old boy grows increasingly alienated from this hockey-obsessed community and is determined to take revenge on the people he holds responsible for his beloved sister‚Äôs death. He has a pistol and a plan that will leave Beartown with a loss that is almost more that it can stand.\n\nAs it beautifully captures all the complexities of daily life and explores questions of friendship, loyalty, loss, and identity, this emotion-packed novel asks us to reconsider what it means to win, what it means to lose, and what it means to forgive.\n\nQOTD: which is your favourite Backman novel and if you haven‚Äôt read him then what are you currently reading?\n\n#coffeeandbooks #currentlyreading #bookishladiesclub #swedishauthor #swedishlit #üá®üá¶bookenablers #thewinners #beartown #usagainstyou #longbook #alwaysreading #heavybook #goodreads #emotionalread #amreading #fredrikbackman #frommylibrary","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/308941585_100583446177844_7975425830755224006_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=8YtbEiRH_V0AX8_Guct&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCg7KymseXZfTT1SXO2yIojueKaC70Oke_uhg3yhIRIfw&oe=636EE1CF&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"The thirst: Jo nesbo\nA woman is found murdered after an internet date.

If I were to speak simply as to what the letter says: it‚Äôs a rundown of the positives and negatives and how they can improve and affirming the good work. They were good at discerning false teachers, particularly the Nicolaitians. These were followers of Nicolas-one of 7 men selected to serve the church in Acts 6:5, but he went the way of the heretic, incorporating much more idolatrous practices and sexual immorality like that of the pagans. Jesus warned them about letting their original love for him and others grow flat, and to return to that original love to flourish. Removing the lampstand if they didn‚Äôt change their tune. This doesn‚Äôt refer to the future end times, as that part of Turkey is now wholly Islamic. Clearly, they failed to heed the warning and make the changes needed. There are great promises made to the believers that overcome and heed what is said. To eat from the Tree of Life in paradise, which speaks of eternity.
