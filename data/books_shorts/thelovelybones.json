[{"text":"My first pick for #throwbackthursday is The Lovely Bones by Alice Seabold. This worldwide, bestselling book was first published in 2002 but I didn’t pick it up until 2013. Once I did, I could not put it down, I was absolutely hooked and adored every page. \n\nIt is the heartbreaking story of a 14 year old girl, Susie Salmon (you always know how much a book means to you when you can remember character names without having to look them up!), who is raped and murdered by a neighbourhood man. She is watching the devasting repercussions on her friends and family from heaven whilst trying to come to terms with her own death. \nBeautifully written, this compelling book had me in tears but was also hopeful and humorous which is surprising given the brutality of the subject matter. \n\nThe Lovely Bones was adapted to film in 2009 which I have never been tempted to see in case it ruins the magic of the book for me. \n\nHave you read or seen The Lovely Bones?

Unfortunately, I was disappointed and found that it approached the topic of Susie’s murder and many other elements throughout the book in a very unnecessarily graphic way. It was a very slow read for me and the only reason I held out to the end is so that I didn’t DNF it. I just couldn’t get into it. The characters were developed in a way that made me dislike them the more I read. It was honestly frustrating at times and the end was by far the worst ending I think I’ve ever read. It was just way too much. Sadly I would not recommend this book but maybe this is another one that’s just not for everyone. \n\nOn the bright side found a nice quote!😊\n\n\"𝑰𝒏 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒎𝒊𝒅𝒔𝒕 𝒐𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒇𝒂𝒊𝒍𝒖𝒓𝒆, 𝒀𝒐𝒖 𝒘𝒆𝒓𝒆 𝒔𝒍𝒐𝒘𝒍𝒚 𝒃𝒖𝒊𝒍𝒅𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒍𝒊𝒇𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒘𝒂𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒂𝒏𝒚𝒘𝒂𝒚.\" \n\n#bookstagram #bookreview #2022readingchallenge #thelovelybonesbook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/307211237_1779495382392114_5134552417493569010_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=thCwOvnmqqYAX820-wP&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBrcRmReLeLhjrMNVezADl4QHNjNTBIqiLNhdcCa0wP5g&oe=636EB994&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"the lovely bones - alice sebold\n\nreview - 4.5/5🌟\n\nthis is such a unique book! i was quite excited for this one after my mum told me how much she loved it. it wasn’t what i was expecting but i was definately pleasantly suprised. \n\ni think it’s powerful in the way it describes the lives of people in mourning... the way it affects families and individuals. i liked the way the author didn’t just describe the actions the characters took but she gets into their minds and shows us WHY they’ve done what they done. you can’t help but feel sorry for everyone despite the events of the book.

Now in heaven, Susie narrates the lives of her family & friends in the aftermath of her death \n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Not many books get me emotional 💔—We Begin At The End & Four Winds are the only books I’ve read to date that have made me tear up 😢 The Lovely Bones is now added to the list. For me, the truly devastating moments were when Susie is watching her parents grieve. Sebold does an amazing job conveying the emotions Susie’s family experiences. Her writing is in a class of its own, which is why I think her book really tugged at my ❤️ when other books haven’t \n\nI appreciated the version of heaven Sebold creates. She doesn’t get overly religious—I think the focus was on a place that offers closure, connection, & guidance. From Susie’s heaven (bc as we’re told, it looks different for everyone) she’s able to watch down on life, interact & reunite w/ others who’ve arrived, & still have a transitory line of communication w/ her family \n\nI wanted to read this when it first came out but I was in middle school & prly wouldn’t have appreciated it, so I’m glad I waited. I know it was turned into a movie but I don’t think I’ll watch it—I really like how Sebold’s story looks in my mind & I don’t want the movie to interfere w/ the picture she painted for me.

And I began to see things in a way that let me hold the world without me in it.'\n\nThis book was a difficult read. I was gripped right from the first sentence, I have never read a book anything like this. \n\nIt is such a powerful book and describes the lives of family and friends in mourning in such a gentle way- it gives us an insight into why some family members made certain choices. All the family members were affected in different ways by the grief of Susie's death and my heart truly went out to all of them especially Susie's Dad- he was seeing his family fall apart in front of his eyes all whilst trying to cope with the death of his first child.\n\nThe concept of being able to watch your loved ones after death is one I've never read about before but this book was written in a compelling, unquie way. The idea of Susie having her own \"personal heaven\" was intriguing. The ending and the part where Susie comes down onto Earth into Ruth's body was.... interesting. \n\nI keep thinking about how even in Susie's 'perfect world' (heaven), she felt lonely as most of her time was spent observing the living.\n\nSaying that, this book will stay with me for a long time❤️\n\n#bookstagram #TheLovelyBones #TheLovelyBonesBook #AliceSebold #books #booklover #bookstagrammer #booknerd #bookclub #thrillerbooks #booksbooksbooks #bookworm #booksofinstagram #bookreviews #bookblogs #bookrecommendations #reading #bookphotography","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/310863378_524745636129665_7408271761552962988_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=ZmqRwtVBW_gAX-5AnHT&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCQjazQVeYzAtOyH4BjOdCrG-4CV7n1yoFb9vSQv15uUg&oe=636F0114&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"📷📖\n\n‘Between the pages of a book is a lovely place to be’\n\nOne of my favorite movies is ‘The Lovely Bones’ which is based on a book by ‘Alice Sebold’.

However, it takes a lot of determination to read a murdered young girl's point of view in the afterlife. While a Mitch Albom book was warm and fuzzy, reading The Lovely Bones was all sadness and misery. Susie Salmon was only fourteen when she got murdered by her neighbor. There is a detailed description of rape from her point of view, which is almost unbearable to read. It is probably the most disturbing book I have ever read in my entire existence. I have never felt so frustrated and uncomfortable while reading a book. Although, The Lovely Bones is not what you consider \"lovely\", there are still beautiful lessons. \n\nNever recommend this book to children. Reading rape from a victim's point of view at 18 years old is traumatizing. I made it through the rest of the book in a state of anxiety and near hysteria. I then finished the book in a daze and kept it in the furthest area of my shelf hidden from my sisters. What's even worse was I had to relive my vivid memories of the book when my friends and I decided to watch the movie adaptation yesterday. I am still recovering. \n\nShort life update, I survived another stressful week. I need to take my time to enjoy the next few weeks of less school work.

I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.\" \n\nSo begins the story of Susie Salmon, who is adjusting to her new home in heaven, a place that is not at all what she expected, even as she is watching life on earth continue without her -- her friends trading rumors about her disappearance, her killer trying to cover his tracks, her grief-stricken family unraveling. Out of unspeakable tragedy and loss, The Lovely Bones succeeds, miraculously, in building a tale filled with hope, humor, suspense, even joy. \n\n📚 My opinion: \n\nThe Lovely Bones is a determined reiteration of innocence, a teeth-gritted celebration of something not dismembered or shattered at all, but continuous: the notion of the family unit, dysfunctional, yes, but pure and good nonetheless. It's a celebration that is hard-won, often vivid, sometimes moving, comic and sweet, but that has to be treated with at least a little unease when you consider how the narrative presents us with its villain, the outsider, who is identified by Susie's family by instinct after they simply perceive the man to be a little odd, and after odd, malevolent. \n\nAt the heart of The Lovely Bones is an unwritten book about loneliness and the ways in which a too-perfect world is stifling. \n\nIf I'm honest, I was a little disappointed with the end of the story but still, the narrative was compelling. Definitely worth reading.\n\n📚 Recommended if you enjoy:\n- Thriller\n\n#bookstagram #books #bookstagrammer #ilovereading #bookreviewer #bibliophile #blogger #bookblogger #52booksin52weeks #book9 #book9of52 #novel #reading # #writing #thelovelybones #thelovelybonesbook #aliceseabold #murder #teenageyears #life #afterlife","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/273225404_120716650310411_3004882341943056809_n.webp?stp=c178.0.724.724a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=Hvw3sd1ndu8AX9jo7ab&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBW_GzJd4PQJgNC4u2p8Dck_UTBS5hfG0KgIm6LFqTiVw&oe=636DD627&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"“Sometimes the dreams that come true are the dreams you never even knew you had.”\n\n― Alice Sebold\nThe Lovely Bones\n\n#AliceSebold #AliceSeboldquotes #TheLovelyBones #TheLovelyBonesquotes #TheLovelyBonesbook #bingereadsph #bookloversph #ebook #ebooklover #ebooks #ebooksph #ebooksphilippines #ebookslibrary #ebookslibraryph #bibliophileph #onlinelibrary #onlinelibraryph #bookwormph #booksph #motivationalquotes #inspiringquotes #mustreadbooks #bookstagram #bookshelfie #bookrecommendations #booksofinstagram #booksforsaleph #goodreads #kindle","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/272662646_2068105000037545_1126656681342867082_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=SgCUNISCRuQAX-47DOf&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBklTLILzicOvJfJ8ywgUL8_cW2P2bzPq7OWkdJwHvtiQ&oe=636F1D5C&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"“i was almost alive again.”\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Lovely Bones\nby Alice Sebold\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWOW!

People who are interested in reading should look into the Trigger Warnings beforehand.\n\n🌀I really enjoyed Sebold’s writing and she did a great job in keeping me interested and wanting to read more. I really enjoyed how we slowly learned more even the murderer even though we knew who it was from the beginning. \n\n😳The reason it lost some stars is I found some of the plot points towards the end to be confusing and for lack of a better word…. icky. I don’t want to give any spoilers, but hopefully those who have read it were as put off by it as I was. But overall really good book.\n\n🎬MOVIE REVIEW: I watched the movie right after finishing the book, and while I understand the book is hard to show in movie form, I was pretty disappointed. The depictions of Susie’s heaven seemed tacky(which I guess could make sense as she is 14years old) and the scene that made me feel icky made even less sense in the movie 😂\n\n~Megan","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/267416843_503375830861074_656265611042002892_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=4FLXNXcN5CgAX9e1v83&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBDRu5KLqacho4jc1A_yLfGg4wxdt9iqF_ksYEW8OuZlQ&oe=636DEFD7&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Before #TheLovelyBones, author Alice Sebold’s career was launched by her memoir Lucky, which told the story of her rape.

The writing style of this book was so intriguing and elegant; and the characters were created beautifully too. Although at times, it was hard to read because of such dark topics, it was very satisfying to read and finish this book, knowing that by the end, things were better than the beginning.
