[{"text":"一 book review 《the handmaid’s tale》\n\n⭑ ⭑ ⭑ ⭑ ⭑\n\n「The Handmaid's Tale (1985) is a novel of speculative fiction by Canadian author Margaret Atwood. Set in a near-future New England, in a totalitarian theocracy which has overthrown the United States government, the dystopian novel explores themes of women in subjugation and the various means by which they gain agency.」\n\n*mild spoilers ahead!*\n\nOH. MY. GOD. this book is insane, in all the good ways possible. i know this opinion won’t last though, since i’m reading this book for my a-level course and i will have to have it open 24/7 soon for those essays 😮‍💨\n\ni really love the way atwood does “show not tell” through offred and other characters. the motifs in the book were clearly shown, and i particularly love the way she uses colour. of course, red is mentioned a lot with the handmaids’ colour being red, but she describes a lot of objects with a specific colour, such as apples and blood.\n\nas a dystopian novel, i think that it does really well in world-building. often times fantasy or dystopian novels spend too much or too little of the story introducing the setting of the story to the readers, but i think atwood’s way of introducing the world as the plot develops works really well for the novel.\n\ni particularly liked the plot twists in the story. there aren’t a lot of big twists, but there are small twists scattered across the book, and i have always preferred small surprises rather than big twists, so this was perfect for me!!!\n-\n-\n-\n\n#book #books #bookrecommendations #bookrecommendation #bookreview #bookstagram #booklover #bookaddict #bookaesthetic #booksbooksbooks #bibliophile  #annotations #annotatedbooks #annotating #annotatingbooks #thehandmaidstale #thehandmaidstalebook #margaretatwood #bookquotes #quotes #academicreading #englishliterature #alevelenglishliterature","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/294085106_195332136183406_5904096671274509980_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=3AUpL_aZnZIAX_a53o-&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAY6Floz7Op_6GVfjG3YSaAPfgeHhYmw3wwYGbVSmh_KA&oe=636F89D8&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"The Testaments is also available in paperback☺️\n\n15% Off on Both Books\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale is the story of life in the dystopia of Gilead, a totalitarian society in what was the United States.

It was hard to comprehend and was quite dense at times but I don't think that subtracted from the overall book. I think I could easily understand the plot and even have an attachment to the characters. The feminist message was great and overall it was such a fun read that im glad I read, even if it is slightly put of my comfort zone ! My only complaint was that the ending felt kinda vague and I'm not sure I like an open to interpretation ending. \n\n#booksta #bookstagram #bookish #bookreview #classics #books #classicsbooks #thehandmaidstale #thehandmaidstalebook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/287920726_136866118998997_6081428896428203982_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=5ogxE2c1KNcAX_i2q5t&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBeow_3CQ3VdNDXwAgtYs8_Lsp3JD09h2Ox_bdxp0sKyA&oe=636F3587&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"She’s gotten so big.

It’s incredibly well written, engaging, unsettling and is painfully relevant nowadays despite being originally published in 1985. Especially when you consider the political landscape of America right now. It is a very disturbing read so it feels odd to say I enjoyed it but it’s so clever, I cannot help but love the book.\n\nOne of my favourite parts of the book is how Atwood uses the colour red to symbolise a whole host of things including; fertility, infertility, oppression, power & violence. Even Offred’s name includes the colour - it is so clever, I could write a whole essay about the use of colour in The Handmaid’s Tale but I’ll spare you all. Storytelling plays a huge role in the book. Offred proves herself to be an unreliable narrator, often telling us a few different versions of events, admitting to us that she does not know what truly happens - yet, we the reader build up a repore with the character and trust her. \n\nThe book is traumatic. Trigger warnings for basically everything under the sun; \n* Cheating\n* Death\n* Family Separation\n* Forced Pregnancy\n* Hanging\n* Oppressive Government\n* Prostitution\n* Rape\n* Sexism\n* Suicide/suicidal ideation \n\nIt is classified as dystopian fiction, but this book is a heavily researched one. Every horrific event has happened at one point or another in some part of the world, near or/and far from us. Many of which continue to happen today. \n\nI’ll wrap this up, before I actually write an essay lol\n\nShockingly brilliant - 5⭐️\n\n. . . . . . . . . \n#blog #blogger #irishbookstagram #irishbookstagrammer #irishbookblogger #bookblog #bookblogger #bookstagram #bookstagrammar #bookworm #leseratte #discoverbookstagram #booktube #booktuber #readingvlog #reading #publishingstudent #gradschool #thehandmaidstalebook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/312725630_654493382993078_6581548857827555000_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=5Z-orQz5qdsAX_0VhIW&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBzpNl33o6r7Zvjd_8wyGZ9DLGE5nA_yAg6YsQKJ2yaZQ&oe=636EFFD4&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"What did you think about this week’s episode?

Don't let the bastards grind you down.”\n― Margaret Atwood, The Handmaid's Tale\n\nWhenever I decide to read a really popular book, that is adored by many, I have a feeling that I need to give it justice that this book should be universally adored and if I don’t do just that, it will reflect negatively on me rather than the book. I Had this feeling before I started The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood, but thankfully I liked it.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is how oppressing the atmosphere the writer sets up in the opening chapters of the book, which is masterfully shown through the writing and keeps up through the book.\n\nThe brilliant thing about the Handmaid’s Tale,is that the dystopian setting of the book seems 100% plausible because it is based on reality to an extent; it feels like we are one bad day away from that reality. Similar to 1984 by George Orwell the central Idea is more important than the plot and the characters and I felt that throughout the book. \n\nI know That in a couple of years I won’t remember the plot or the characters that much, but the idea and the message will be ingrained in my mind for a long time. 8/10\n\n#thehandmaidstale #thehandmaidstalebook  #handmaidstale #margretatwood #atwood #bookreview #bookstagram #bookgram #bookish #unitedbookstagram #2022reads","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/310959864_1570777510044065_6713621972298606845_n.jpg?stp=c0.129.1034.1034a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=81NsCp7yVxUAX9S9ypE&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD2qTKeOEFikLRqJw_r4xp7Y0RDZO3-LQXy-DulbORtYg&oe=636F73D8&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"🤍🤍🤍🤍 #thehandmaidstale #elcuentodelacriada #thehandmaidstalebook #thehandmaidstalehulu #instagram #instagood #instalike #instadaily #instamood #insta #starbucks #cookie #me #selfie #septum #septumpiercing #filter #filterinstagram #greeneyes","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/310705927_167368562637986_5608976891836417680_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=zjN_0U1WJLsAX8LbDcR&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCuErZZGUBup-4HVtmU979mDcAodeYBq-g8UxHtjMF_Rw&oe=636E8CE0&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"#thehandmaidstale #thehandmaidstalebook #brainonfire #brainonfirebook #alongwayhome #alongwayhomebook #cocooningmoment #cocooningtime #readingtime #readingmoment #cozytime #cozymoment #autumn2022","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/310818993_3434111043538466_782016575828304260_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=fK62bIw0gjwAX86KgJ4&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBHswQerHbw0BOTsg5uLgyRyiU0ZYtlbUI7mDddnDWb7Q&oe=636E377A&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"What’s the most terrifying book you’ve read?\n\nI’m a wuss, so I don’t read a lot of horror.  But well, Margaret Atwood still found a way to scare the bejeezus out of me. \n\nTHE HANDMAID’S TALE by @therealmargaretatwood is a book that is one of the greats, and is simply so effective because it doesn’t take a huge leap of imagination to believe that a society could go from what it is today, to the corrupt theological one in the book where women are relegated to very specific roles, and those who refuse to conform are removed and sent to a much worse place. It wonderfully shows how crippling such a setting can be for everyone involved, and has wonderfully horrid depictions of the patriarchal bargain.\n\nI would’ve missed out on so much if I hadn’t given this another go. If you put it down the first time because the narration didn’t work for you, I urge you to pick it up, it is truly something to be experienced. (Please check trigger warnings)\n\nShoutout to the amazing staff at my local bookstore who removed the sticker from this one for me! When I re-read this book, I will post a detailed review.\n\n__________________\n#margaretatwoodbooks #margaretatwood #thehandmaidstaleoffred #gilead #vintageatwood #speculativefiction #specfic #specfiction #specfictionbooks #bookrecommendations #booksbooksbooks #booksbooksandmorebooks #modernclassicbooks #modernclassics #vintagebooks #mustreadbook #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #bookblogger #fantasyreader #fantasyreadersofinstagram #fantasyreadersofig #thehandmaidstale #thehandmaidstalebook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/311183997_857785748756858_1295032271779405819_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=ku0-yavUCUAAX-Dn166&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBwwDYcSPX59R44AuWEtX89iFz1MxjP4eUm091Z1dEp0w&oe=636E6199&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Tell us what you thought of Episode 5, Fairytale, now streaming on Hulu.\n\n##thehandmaidstalebymargaretatwood #thehandmaidstale #handmaids #thehandmaidstaleseason1 #thehandmaidstaleseason2 #thehandmaidstaleseason3 #thehandmaidstaleoffred #thehandmaidstalebook #thehandmaidstaleseries #nickandjune #praisebe #underhiseye #juneosborne #nickblaine #blessedbethefruit #handmaidsonhulu #nolitebastardescarborundorum #hulu","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/310494608_654963222949860_3170794412709458883_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=OHAXAH_IbsIAX8p37bu&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBef1ZeHPgrxoCwO8t83iaENy7OP75V0pylGOoFoSAZgw&oe=636F1321&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"«Esiste più di un genere di libertà, diceva Zia Lydia.

Aradaki sınıflar da kız evlatlar (eşlerin evlat edinilmiş kızları), Martha'lar (ev işleriyle ilgili yetenekleri sayesinde kolonilere gönderilmekten sıyıran bekar, kısır, orta yaşlı kadınlar) ve Teyzeler'den (Damızlık`ları eğitip gözlemlemek için kullanılan, özerkliği olan tek grup) oluşur.
