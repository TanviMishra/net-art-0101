[{"text":"üìöBook Tour & Book Reviewüìö\n\nQOTD: What‚Äôs your favorite musical group/artist? \n\nThank you to @turnthepagetours & @simonteen for this copy of Bright by Jessica Jung! I have a giveaway up for this on my blog, link in my linktree. \n\nSYNOPSIS:\nThe sequel to the instant New York Times bestseller Shine! \nCrazy Rich Asians meets Gossip Girl in this knockout series from Jessica Jung, K-pop legend, fashion icon, and founder of the international luxury brand, Blanc & Eclare.\n\nCouture gowns, press parties, international travel. Rachel Kim is at the top of her game. Girls Forever is now the number-one K-pop group in the world, and her fame skyrockets after her viral airport styling attracts the attention of fashion‚Äôs biggest names. Her life‚Äôs a swirl of technicolor glamour and adoring fans. Rachel can‚Äôt imagine shining any brighter.\nThe only thing that‚Äôs missing is love‚Äîbut Rachel‚Äôs determined to follow the rules. In her world, falling in love can cost you everything.\nEnter Alex. When Rachel literally falls head over designer heels into his lap on a crowded metro, she‚Äôs tempted to give up her anti-love vows. Alex is more than just heart-stopping dimples and adorably quirky banter. He believes in Rachel‚Äôs future‚Äîboth in music and in fashion.\nBut the higher you rise, the farther you have to fall. And when a shocking act of betrayal shatters her world, Rachel must finally listen to her heart.\n\nMy Review:\n4/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è \nI really enjoyed this book just as much as Shine. I was a little confused at first over the 5 year time jump, but I loved seeing Rachel 5 years in the future. This definitely kept my attention, and I loved the romance, drama, and intrigue! The petty drama within this group‚Ä¶ Wow. But if you love Kpop I highly suggest you read these books, I do wonder how much is based off of Jessica‚Äôs own experience! Maybe she will share that one day.\n\n#turnthepagetours #BRIGHTtour #Shinebook #Brightbook #jessicajung #abookishdream #bookstagramgiveaway #bookgiveaway #giveaway #bookstagram #bookish #booksta #bookstagramfeature #bookishfeature #bookstafeature #bookstagrammer #booknerdigans #bookaesthetic #bookgram #booklove #bookcommunity #booktography #booksonbooks #ireadya","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/279444677_166023509193812_8126943294792038226_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=lD9emS4sdi8AX__A3Rd&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD-8A_VMKlRpb-8XRK6hc6RUUtPPUCKiM0dAdk4NSGS9A&oe=636F13D7&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Favorite read of April? \n\nTo me, April simultaneously flew by and dragged. The last few weeks felt like months, but April as a whole feels like a blink. That might partly be helped by the fact that my reading was soooooo slow. With AP exams and tests, I spent way too much time studying, and nowhere near enough time reading. \n\nBut now, I can get back to reading!! Took my environmental science exam on Tuesday, and my English one today. My brain is dead, and I can't write for the life of me, but I did it!! Don't have to study anymore, I can dive right back into reading! \n\nSo of course, the first thing I did after getting home today was binge Bright. It was so adorable! The perfect read for a brain-dead binge, it was sheer fluff and fun. It was exactly what I needed after a long day :D \n\n#turnthepagetours #BRIGHTtour #Shinebook #Brightbook #jessicajung\n#bookstagram #bookstagrammer #smallfavors #thehoneys #springstack #booklove #standalone #spring #pastels #books #flatlay #cottagecore #flowercrown #reader #bookaesthetic #yabooks","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/279814358_547132890174925_7170874011238255174_n.webp?stp=c240.0.960.960a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=Be1GQLAtIEAAX81LvBK&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCBo-eoj20FgwlrN4JRMgzPu8wc3nDwqvEZ-wa4V6SczQ&oe=636F18C4&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"üå±‚Ä¶\n-\n#outie #book #bookaesthetic #converseallstar #goodvibes #flowers #shinebook ##jessicajung #sky #sunest #tree #clouds #army #ÔΩÅÔΩÖÔΩìÔΩîÔΩàÔΩÖÔΩîÔΩâÔΩÉ #aesthetic #out #outfit #üåø #reading","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/285032922_1237539887052789_5025612185207247955_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=1zRaoGXmHz0AX9gGu13&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDKd1akU2FfO3D5nXpDAf5efSRmgHNg_J-vH-T-3JKpAw&oe=636E5C7B&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"‚≠êÔ∏èGIVEAWAY‚≠êÔ∏è\nWelcome to my stop on @TurnthePageTours‚Äô release tour for Bright by @jessica.syj!

Fortunately, this was not at all the case!  Jessica Jung pulled me into the world of K-Pop seamlessly, providing context when necessary and allowing me to focus on the story rather than on the unfamiliarity of the world. I loved the characters, the drama, and the high stakes that come along with fame.  I was especially a fan of how the romance between Rachel and Alex was written in Bright.  Their connection felt believable and relatable, even if their circumstances are a bit different than my own.\n\nMy Recommendation- \nWhether or not you listen to a lot of K-Pop, Shine and Bright are both such engaging and fun reads!  I would especially recommend this book to people who enjoy reading about life in the spotlight, and the challenges that come along with being in the public eye!\n\n#TurnThePageTours #BRIGHTTour #ShineBook #BrightBook #JessicaJung #KPop #KPopBooks #YaBooks #YaBookstagram #BookBirthday #BookTour #BookBlog #BlogTour #BookGiveaway #FreeBooks #Giveaway #Bookish #NewBook #Reading #Read #BookWorm #ContemporaryBooks #FunBooks","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/279768224_2283666361774784_4943113775363512423_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=fnrBPkHDsPQAX8qP16R&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD30qFr-sHhQjGqfB-egkbHSHVUnJ7nFvYIOZpgHXNHuw&oe=636F6114&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Are you a fan of K-pop fiction or books about bands?

I‚Äôm not great at keeping up with new music and bands, but it felt impossible not to eventually get caught up in K-pop somehow. It was admittedly the K-pop fans, their enthusiasm, and the way they banded together to protest that caught my attention more than the music. But I‚Äôm slowly listening to more and more. \nüåü\nI dipped my toe into this scene far too late to recognize who Jessica Jung is (K-pop legend and former lead singer of the girl group Girls Generation from 2007-2014) but I always find it really intriguing when people write about something they are intimately familiar with. (I admittedly picked up Bill Clinton‚Äôs presidential thriller because I was just too curious what a former president would write about in a fiction book about a president). I‚Äôve always thought it would be cool to be a talented and famous singer and I‚Äôm eager to find some interviews by Jessica Jung to see in what ways her career influenced her book, and to dive into it!\nüåü\nSynopsis: \nWhat would you give for a chance to live your dreams? For seventeen-year-old Korean American Rachel Kim, the answer is almost everything. Six years ago, she was recruited by DB Entertainment‚Äîone of Seoul‚Äôs largest K-pop labels, known for churning out some of the world‚Äôs most popular stars. The rules are simple: Train 24/7. Be perfect. Don‚Äôt date. Easy right? Not so much. As the dark scandals of an industry bent on controlling and commodifying beautiful girls begin to bubble up, Rachel wonders if she‚Äôs strong enough to be a winner, or if she‚Äôll end up crushed‚Ä¶ Especially when she begins to develop feelings for K-pop star and DB golden boy Jason Lee. It‚Äôs not just that he‚Äôs charming, sexy, and ridiculously talented. He‚Äôs also the first person who really understands how badly she wants her star to rise.¬†\nüåü\n#shine #shinebook #jessicajung #girlsgeneration #kpop #arc #advancedreaderscopy #onthebed #kpopidol #kpopers #kpoplover #kpopworld #kpopnews #kpoplove #jessicajungfans #jessicajungisback","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/120736992_745128122702431_2310699327175890176_n.jpg?stp=c0.156.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=DKX7mKjG5poAX89JgI_&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBNlkF7BOMHsXiQ-dpNxs-VOSiHBXkPn-1hktEgjourMQ&oe=636E7F6E&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"‚Ä¢ Muitas pessoas desistem dos seus sonhos ou alvos por causa do medo.

Down-to-earth portrayal of what it is like to begin a life as a musician and performer in Korea. Talks about the exploitation by big entertainment companies, the poor living conditions, the pressure and impossible expectations, the double standards and sexism, among many other (often taboo) issues in the industry. Also showcases the love for the art, the magic of performing and doing what you love. Can't wait for the sequel.\n.\nCons: Lackluster romance and romantic interest.

Who are some of your favorite artists? ü´∂\n\nSome of my favorites are IU, BTS, Seventeen, Twice, Mamamoo, and SNSD! I also recently started listening to Enhypen!\n\nI remember when Shine came out, I was super interested in reading a novel written by a kpop idol. And now the sequel, Bright by Jessica Jung, is coming out! üíì\n\nA few years after the events that occurred in Shine, we follow Rachel as she falls in love and tries to find her true self. Similarly to the first book, Rachel is subjected to the harsh dynamics faced as an idol within the kpop industry with unexpected betrayals. Drama and intrigue thus ensue, along with a possible romance? üëÄ\n\nCompared to the first book, Bright focuses a little less on the criticism and critique that comes alongside fame and more on the romance that develops between Rachel and Alex. I must admit, I did find the first book a bit more intriguing as we learn about everything behind-the-scenes of a kpop idol (written from a kpop idol herself)! There's a lot of double standards, body shaming, and foul play as Rachel enters the industry. That's not to say that she isn't subjected to similar treatment even after she's become more famous, but the author has instead chosen to prioritize Rachel's journey in self-discovery more in this sequel. We learn more about Rachel's entry into the world of fashion and music as well as how she manages a potential relationship.\n\nAs someone who got into kpop somewhat more recently (around 2 years ago?), I found this duology to be fascinating insight into the kpop industry and the struggles that idols face. I still wonder to what extent these stories are fiction, and how much of Rachel's experiences mirror the authors...ü§î\n\nThank you to @turnthepagetours and @simonteen for sending me this copy and allowing me to join this tour!

Everything that I loved about Shine is still present in this book - the fashion, the music, the drama, but there are darker elements as well. We get to examine some of the more toxic group dynamics of Girls Forever, as well as how far people will go to get ahead. It was amazing seeing Rachel enter the world of fashion and business, but I hope we get a third book still. Maybe with another time skip? Rachel's story is far from over, and she definitely has some unsettled business. (Also Alex is THE cutest boyfriend.

They are both gorgeous and I can‚Äôt decide which one is my favorite. \n\nBright is a ‚ÄòCrazy Rich Asians meets Gossip Girl in this knockout series from Jessica Jung, K-pop legend, fashion icon, and founder of the international luxury brand, Blanc & Eclare.‚Äô Full synopsis in comments ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n#turnthepagetours #BRIGHTtour #Shinebook #Brightbook #jessicajung","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/279758780_522925776035544_7401243893817189190_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=EiiKDQZg2jcAX-OTgFc&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBu8d42HCfNSOPXjKhYY7jh1LJG0YmxKDxI1h0DUb2Vcg&oe=636E7F19&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"2: –°–õ–ê–í–ê ‚Ä¢ –î–ñ–ï–°–ò–ö–ê –ß–û–ù ‚Ä¢ –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–≤–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–ª–Ω–∏ –ø–æ—Ä—ä—á–∫–∏ –Ω–∞ egmontbulgaria.com ‚ú® –í –∫–Ω–∏–∂–∞—Ä–Ω–∏—Ü–∏—Ç–µ –æ—Ç 14 –º–∞–π üè∞\n\nüåü –ü—Ä–æ–¥—ä–ª–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ #–ë–ª—è—Å—ä–∫ üåü\n\n–†–µ–π—á—ä–ª –ö–∏–º –µ –Ω–∞ –≤—ä—Ä—Ö–∞ –Ω–∞ —Å–ª–∞–≤–∞—Ç–∞ –∏ –∏–∑–∂–∏–≤—è–≤–∞ –º–µ—á—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ —Å–∏. –¢—É—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç–∞—Ç–∞, –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ –∏ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ—Ä—Ç–∏—Ç–µ —Å–∞ —á–∞—Å—Ç –æ—Ç –µ–∂–µ–¥–Ω–µ–≤–∏–µ—Ç–æ —ù, –∞ ‚Äû–ì—ä—Ä–ª—Å –§–æ—Ä–µ–≤—ä—Ä‚Äú –µ –Ω–∞–π-–∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –∫-–ø–æ–ø –≥—Ä—É–ø–∞ –≤ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–∞. –í—Å–∏—á–∫–æ –≤ –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–∞ —ù –∏–∑–≥–ª–µ–∂–¥–∞ —Å—ä–≤—ä—Ä—à–µ–Ω–æ. \n\n–ï–¥–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–æ—Ç–æ, –∫–æ–µ—Ç–æ –ª–∏–ø—Å–≤–∞ –µ –ª—é–±–æ–≤. –î–æ–∫–∞—Ç–æ –Ω–µ —Å—Ä–µ—â–∞ –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å.\n\n–ó–∞–ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ç–æ –∏–º –ø—Ä–µ–æ–±—Ä—ä—â–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ —ù –∑–∞ –ª—é–±–æ–≤ –∏ –Ω–∞ –†–µ–π—á—ä–ª —ù —Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞ –≤—Å–µ –ø–æ-—Ç—Ä—É–¥–Ω–æ –¥–∞ —Å–ø–∞–∑–≤–∞ –Ω–∞–π-–≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–æ –≤ –∫-–ø–æ–ø–∞: –ù–∏–∫–æ–≥–∞ –Ω–µ —Å–µ –≤–ª—é–±–≤–∞–π.\n\n–î–∞–ª–∏ —â–µ —É—Å–ø–µ–µ –¥–∞ –∑–∞–≥—ä—Ä–±–∏ –∂–µ–ª–∞–Ω–∏—è—Ç–∞ —Å–∏, –∏–ª–∏ –Ω–∞–π-–Ω–∞–∫—Ä–∞—è —â–µ —Å–µ –≤—Å–ª—É—à–∞ –≤ —Å—ä—Ä—Ü–µ—Ç–æ —Å–∏? üíñ ‚ú®\n\n#–ù–æ–≤–∞–ö–Ω–∏–≥–∞ #–î–∂–µ—Å–∏–∫–∞–ß–æ–Ω #–°–ª–∞–≤–∞ #–ë–ª—è—Å—ä–∫ \n#JessicaJung #SHINE #shinebook #shineseries \n\n#Egmont #–ï–≥–º–æ–Ω—Ç #–¢–∏–π–Ω #Teen #RomanticBook #KPOP #KPOPBOOK\n\n#book #reading #romanticnovels\n#egmontbulgaria #instabooks #bookstagram #booksaremagic #bookcommunity #booksforlife #booksofinstagram #readingismagic #bookloversofinstagram #readersofinsta","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/279390727_569659081026815_4010083771684838260_n.jpg?stp=c0.135.1080.1080a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=Vh50htNZ8hIAX8IPEh3&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAyvCgHYPg38xpzN61dmTQqFKWw9x3ImVq7Wduwm3T_dg&oe=636F3E47&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"üå∑Spring Vibesüå∑ \n\nSummer is coming so fast, and I have to say it‚Äôs not my favorite season because sometimes it gets too hot ‚òÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm going to miss Spring a lot \n\nI was reading So This Is Ever After, but I decided to put it down for now so I can read something that isn‚Äôt fantasy.

There is an undeniable potency in holy repetition, and I, for one, have a deep need for it. If we rehearse the truth that we are indeed the beloved of God through Christ, then when circumstances challenge that immutable truth, spiritual muscle memory will take over. The truth will rise, and the lie will sink- if the truth has been deeply rehearsed into our spiritual sinews.\n.\nI‚Äôm reminding my heart today: rehearse what is true, what is reflective of the Gospel, what embodies the ways and words of the Divine Author of Hebrews. For, in every sense that truly matters, I will be what I rehearse.
