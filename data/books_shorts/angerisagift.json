[{"text":"Anger is a Gift by Mark Oshiro\n•\nRating: 5/5\n•\nReview: I have always loved books that felt honest, raw, and real and this book checked all of those boxes. I was continually engaged and I always wanted to know what was going to happen next. This book was sadly all too similar to our world, with black communities being at a continual disadvantage and the police being able to do what they want without being held accountable. It is so important that books like these exist so we can examine society and question the powers that be. We must stand up for what is right and make change as the characters of this book fought to do. Definitely a must read!","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/117972185_1613971445452353_825164543618835312_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=nV6cTUd4otgAX8A-U8P&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAmUr77Wnzy0JS1xwEErzDZsQ8zqYei4bvalpUKBQPO0Q&oe=636ED479&_nc_sid=76ac9f"}]
