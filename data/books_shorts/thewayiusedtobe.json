The novel is told in four parts of the main character Eden’s life. Her freshman, sophomore, junior and senior year. One night when Eden is 14, she is sexual assaulted by her brothers best friend. She doesn’t tell anyone about what happened. As she tries to tell her mother the fear from her assaulters threats stops her. So she carries the weight of the trauma alone. As the story evolves, you see how the trauma of the assault and the painful secret effects her relationships, her decisions and self worth. The book is a really hard read especially the chapter on her assault and Eden’s coping mechanisms. \n\nEden is so strong, she’s real and imperfect. She was put simply, trying to cope with what had happened to her. Her experience is her own. I think the novel correctly shows the trauma that a rape leaves behind. It’s deeply emotional to read, as Eden is tormented by the lasting effects. But it also feels healing, as you see Eden process and work through her pain. \n\nThis book touched my heart, I cried the whole way through. It is so painful to read but you can’t put it down. It’s a book that has really stuck with me. I felt so angry, sad and devastated reading it. It’s a moving and powerful novel. \n\nIt is written so well Smith did a wonderful job. Whilst the book breaks my heart, I am so grateful a novel like this exists. It really helps young girls as it shines a light on these horrific experiences and perhaps brings some level of peace to survivors. Eden’s story is one that will always be close to my heart 💛💛. \n\nI highly recommend this one to everyone it’s truly worth it. 💛✨🌼🌻\n\n🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟/5\n\nFavourite Quote - “All these maybes swimming around my head make me think “maybe” could just be another word for hope.”\n\n#bookrecs #bookstagram #bookreview #booklover #bookish #bookaddict#bookworm #booklove #bookrecommendations #bookcommunity #bookstagram #bookreview #bookrecommendation #thewayiusedtobe #thewayiusedtobebook","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/290247516_5117852898299238_2404753132500258480_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=R26pTdZjAesAX_Vphe6&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCNjY1S_pjvxcWGGL-CEqGVu7F6KFvuMvCVdCsFOK02yg&oe=636E0223&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"5/5 ⭐️\n\nWhen I tell you this book was one of the most raw, emotional and powerful books I’ve ever read, I’m not lying. I’m starting this of with the big trigger warning: rape. The title of this book is the perfect way to describe how our main character, Eden goes through life after being raped. She is definitely not the person she used to be. Eden was quite a difficult character for me to understand, but you can’t understand a person if you’ve never experienced what they have. This was one of the first books that every page I turned, I just wanted to scream at her to tell somebody what she went through. But all she did was continuously hurt those she loved so deeply because, well, she was hurting too. Being a stand alone book, the character development is AMAZING. I truly felt like I learned a lot about how certain life altering moments can affect people. \n\n#bookstagram #bookblog #booktok #bookstagrammer #bookrecommendations #booksofinstagram #yabooks #yabookstagrammer #bookish #thewayiusedtobebook #ambersmithbooks #bookaddict","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/163582459_155813123059726_4029173807872459696_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=Z4FM42IYqzsAX-ouWUG&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBJxBbIhU_JwtgO5vPeZJH7kQN-BWC89kOykZAIDRygcg&oe=636ED6F4&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"The way I used to be- Amber Smith\n★ ★ ★ ★\n“ And I’m trying so hard to just go back to my life.

I actually finished this book about a week ago but got caught up reading other stuff that I forgot to review it. “The Way I Used to Be” tells the story of Eden and her journey to put herself back together after being raped by a close family friend. The book is told in 4 parts, detailing her freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years of high school. At its heart, it’s a story about how one event can change your entire life, and how hard it can be to pick up the pieces and move forward. \n\nI had a really good time reading this book, it definitely dealt with tough subject matter and had me crying on more than one occasion.

Wenn nicht, lasst es lieber. Ich hab’s einfach geliebt. Die Handlungen von Eden waren gleichzeitig so krass, aber auch irgendwie so nachvollziehbar. Ich habe so mit ihr gefühlt und gelitten, es ist unfassbar😮‍💨\nDie Geschichte ist wirklich schwer zu verdauen und definitiv nichts für schwache Nerven. Und obwohl ich das Buch vor knapp 2 Wochen beendet habe, löst es immer noch ein beklemmendes Gefühl in mir aus, wenn ich intensiver darüber nachdenke. Und das mit einem Buch zu schaffen, ist eine Kunst🤍\nHier einmal noch der Klappentext für euch: Eden was always good at being good. Starting high school didn’t change who she was. But the night her brother’s best friend rapes her, Eden’s world capsizes.\n\nWhat was once simple, is now complex. What Eden once loved—who she once loved—she now hates. What she thought she knew to be true, is now lies. Nothing makes sense anymore, and she knows she’s supposed to tell someone what happened but she can’t. So she buries it instead. And she buries the way she used to be.\n\nTold in four parts—freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior year—this provocative debut reveals the deep cuts of trauma. But it also demonstrates one young woman’s strength as she navigates the disappointment and unbearable pains of adolescence, of first love and first heartbreak, of friendships broken and rebuilt, and while learning to embrace a power of survival she never knew she had hidden within her heart.\n*\n#thewayiusedtobebook#thewayiusedtobe#summerofheartsandsouls#instagram#book#books#reading#passion#booksaremylife#bookstagram#bookstagramgermany#germany#2022#read#love#booklove#bookworm#bookish#empfehlung","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/290091299_5881064815242990_1359652016913707161_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=BL3997tu0F8AX-ipb5G&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCp9GgK5UN4Fd8zveATA2wiDgGJUTXH7Df2t0KrQXMWlA&oe=636DFBD5&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"This book hurt so bad.

It really hurt! But the respect and love I had for her throughout the book was insane!\n\nAfter a horrible event you see the aftermath and how this event affects Edens life throughout freshman, sophomore, junior and senior year.

You also get to see how she navigates her emotions.\n\nThere were many parts throughout the book where I related to Eden and her lack of trust! I understood what she was going through in parts of the book and how certain events can make you feel and act a certain way. This just made me love the book even more!\n\nI feel that when you can relate to a book you just have this extra level of love and connection to it🥰\n\nI loved Josh’s character and what he brought to the book. I know a lot of people didn’t like the ending but I thought it was fantastic!\n\nYou need to realise that Eden needed to find who she was on her own two feet and needed to work through her trauma by herself while having people there for her!\n\nOverall this was a very very good book and I will forever hold it close to my heart!

Comenzar la escuela secundaria no cambió su esencia. Pero una noche todo cambia y el mundo de Eden da un vuelco. Lo que antes era simple, ahora es complejo. Lo que Eden una vez amó, a quien una vez amó, ahora lo odia. Lo que ella pensó que sabía que era verdad, ahora son mentiras. Ya nada tiene sentido, y sabe que se supone que debe contarle a alguien lo que sucedió, pero no puede. Así que en su lugar, lo entierra, y entierra la forma en que solía ser.

Pero también demuestra la fortaleza de una mujer joven mientras navega por la decepción y los dolores insoportables de la adolescencia, el primer amor y el primer desamor, las amistades rotas y reconstruidas, y mientras, aprende a abrazar un poder de supervivencia que nunca supo que tenía escondido dentro de su corazón.\n\nMI OPINIÓN:\nESTE LIBRO ME DESTROZA.\nMe duele, me quema y me lastima.\nEmpecemos por Eden, quiero abrazarla y no dejarla ir nunca.\nOdio a Kevin, nunca creí que pudiese odiar tanto a un personaje y estoy feliz con como se dieron las cosas para él al final.\nJosh.

Si acostarte con alguien significa exponerte a un corazón roto, al ridículo o al dolor, no sé si estaré preparada algún día.\n\nMI OPINIÓN:\nMe gustó mucho este libro,  es muy dulce y si te gustan los clichés con un poco de spicy sobre mejores amigos que se lanzan miraditas, este definitivamente es tu momento de leerlo.\nSi bien quise darle con la silla a Andrew y a Keely un par de veces, la historia en general es muy divertida y rápida de leer.\nAndrew es mi nuevo novio del momento.\n4/5💫\n\n#bookstagram #librosrecomendados #librosjuveniles #libros #rexomendacionlibros #recomendaciones #lovequotes #thewayiusedtobebook #thewayiusedtobe #bookstagram #booklover #booknerd #bookaddict","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/279832934_165723579151444_6760766809171970851_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=vVjua0c6y94AX_zzl1Y&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfC_38PxhW_gjarJrHCdeAUTUE3vDwklSIhsFDbGzcV8ew&oe=636F06A0&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"This was such an easy read but it took me more than I planned to finish reading. It was because I knew I was going to get heartbroken and I was procrastinating. So today, solely for this reason I took my book with me and went to a coffee shop, sat at a table that was directly under the sun and I finished this book. Honestly I think it was not the best decision to read the last part of the book in public because I tried very hard to hold my tears. \n•\nReading this book was a different experience. It proves to you how one messed up person can cause a chain reaction and ruin bunch of people’s lives. I felt so much and I think that is because the author expressed feelings so genuinely. At times I was frustrated with the heroine and at times I was frustrated with other characters in the book. And during this the author never gave me a chance to be angry with a character more than a few pages. Her writing gives you so much insight on how all of the characters feel and you find yourself empathising even with the characters you don’t want to empathise. Except the antihero of this book. In the book his reasoning for being this way is briefly mentioned but never in detail. I can’t empathise with him. I. Will. Not.\n•\nCW: this book talks about sexual assault in detail and focuses on Heroine’s inner struggles/ feelings after she was sexually assaulted. \n•\nThe things this book thought me and made me remember:\n\nReach out to people. Talk to professionals. And when you are strong enough, talk about it so others can learn from you and maybe also find the courage to speak up. \n\nEspecially tell the ones who want to ignore your struggles. Make them uncomfortable. Don’t let them act like everything is okay. Particularly, if you are form a culture in which people advise you to take bunch of precautions, who ask you why you were wearing what you were wearing and why were you out so late. Don’t. Let. Them. \n\nAnd lastly if you are a parent, always remind your kids that you are their safe space. That there is nothing in this world that would diminish your love for them. I was a lucky kid and I still am because there wasn’t one moment I felt like my mother wasn’t on my side.","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/279619589_132744332681640_8706438860544476921_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=zhVVM6sYZWEAX9YYizJ&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCRuXB8dP0bfngmBaKgO14wABTX5dErTpaF4It-n3eUlg&oe=636E3FEC&_nc_sid=76ac9f"}]
