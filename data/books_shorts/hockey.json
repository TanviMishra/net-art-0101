[{"text":"Hard to believe it’s been 3 years since Speed Training for Hockey was released. \n\nWhen @fitness_pollenator and I sat down to map out the book, our goal was to put together a comprehensive resource that details all of the factors that can improve a player’s speed, written specifically for youth players, parents, and coaches. \n\nWe included a 12-week off-season training program to both illustrate how all the pieces fit together into a cohesive training plan, and to provide readers with a program they can follow to start making immediate improvements. We also included a comprehensive video database of all the exercises referenced in the book, so readers know exactly how each exercise should be performed. \n\nOver the last 3 years, we’ve received great feedback about Speed Training for Hockey from players, parents, coaches, performance specialists, and rehab professionals alike. \n\n✅ If you’re interested in grabbing a copy, you can find the book on Amazon, or check out http://SpeedTrainingforHockey.com (which also has more information about the book). \n\n✅ If you already have a copy, feel free to share your thoughts about the book in the comments section below, or tag a friend that you think would benefit from grabbing a copy. \n\n🔥 We appreciate all your support over the last 3 years, and look forward to hearing from more players about the results they get from using the Speed Training for Hockey program this off-season!","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/280562653_124837260196247_1554237673818403700_n.jpg?stp=c0.179.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=KKg_uv23hE8AX-RBgMz&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCRGq_1gi8mkAQOg6aV-TBIBlAWGMmpetWI03hJ5V59sw&oe=636E6949&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"You walk into a book fair in grade 4 with 10 bucks in your pocket.

Tell lies. Catch no fish.”\n\nThe third and final book in the Beartown series did not disappoint. I am a person who has liked only these three Fredrik Bachman books out of all the ones I’ve read, but I love them enough to make up for the others. \n\nSet two years after the second book, things really pick up almost where they left off. Hockey, love, hate, addiction, rivalry, family, loyalty, life…so many things. There are so many characters and POVs here, but they’re all well known and developed. The suspense Bachman creates a bit of a mystery throughout, even though that’s not the point at all. \n\nI don’t care anything about hockey, but I love these books even though that’s what they are centered around. \n\n“We are the bears! The bears from Beartown!” 🐻\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nWhat’s your favorite sport?

It was built on hockey and somehow still stands for it. Every person in the town bleeds the colors, goes to every game, and has all of their hopes on their junior national team winning the national championship this year to put their town back on the map! This could get them sponsors, jobs and be everything this town needs and more! However, with having a great team comes great pressure on these young men. After a huge win that puts the boys further into the tournament, a violent act is committed that will leave a young girl traumatized. **Trigger warning- rape\\violence** When she comes forward, no one is safe, no suspect is left unquestioned and the town is torn apart. \n\nThis one really tugged at my heartstrings. The pressures of being a teenager, finding yourself, fitting in, being successful, being a good family member, “making it” and more were all touched upon in ways that matter in this book. As a teacher, coach and former division one athlete I have seen what certain pressures of society do to teenagers. This is an important read for everyone! I will be continuing this series ASAP! \n\nRead it and see what you think!! \n\nHappy reading! 🤓📚✨\n-Bookwormbfigss \n\n#33of2022 #beartown #fredrikbackman #beartownseries #fictionbooks #booksbooksbooks #hockeybook #booklovers #booknerd #teenagepressure","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/288880237_1213742052733469_3956404224653036659_n.jpg?stp=c0.180.1440.1440a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=bcaW8_8873UAX9MP_q4&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAIb-7rE-qLAs7EKJx08HGMwRgc5CPSp81TtzGK8dZK5g&oe=636F49A3&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"💗 Book Review 💗⁣\n⁣\nAlways Only You  Chloe Liese⁣\nPub date: AUGUST 4TH⁣\n⁣\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💫⁣\n⁣\nChloe Liese is literally one of the most gifted writers I've ever had the pleasure of reading! Always Only You is the second book in the Bergman Brother's series and it gave me ALL the feels! This #ownvoices novel gives us a strong, independent, and genuine autistic main character, Frankie and a sexy yet sensitive hockey stud Ren. There are so many laugh out loud moments, sweet little pieces that melt your heart, and a peek inside the beautiful mind of an autistic person. So much of this book brought a smile to my face and really opened my mind.

It was a bit slow to start and at times I felt like it dragged a bit (I mean 688 pages is a REALLY long book!!), but I loved reading all about my favorite characters (Amat, Alicia, Sune, Kira, Maya, Bobo) and meeting new characters too.\n\nThe book came to a tidy-ish end, but I'd LOVE to see a new book or series focused on the WOMEN of Beartown - Alicia, Tess, Hannah, Kira, Maya, etc., etc., etc!  These women are so strong and have so much to offer readers.  Perhaps we'll see them again some day!?!!?!\n\nThe Winners releases September 27, 2022.

But I can already tell that my favourite book club bro is the big softie, Vlad Konnikov aka “The Russian” 😍🧸 He is the ultimate teddy bear and goes against the typical tough-guy-hockey-bro stereotype. I love that he was such a hopeless romantic and I rooting so hard for him and Elena throughout the whole book. I really enjoyed the friends-to-lovers and marriage of convenience tropes at play and the plenty of cheesy moments scattered throughout the book. It was a nice change to read about sensitive male characters for once. The BBC guys are mostly stereotypical macho guys: Pro athletes, famous singer, etc but what really got me was how sweet, supportive, emotional, and ride-or-die these guys were for each other. I can’t wait to read the rest of this series. Truly a feel good book ♥️ \n\nHave you read the Bromance Book Club series?

Detto questo, non credo che Mira avrebbe potuto scrivere la storia in modo diverso, e ciò per cui le do i miei applausi è il fatto che non l'ha trascinata fuori, o ha lasciato che prendesse il sopravvento sulla storia di Quinn e George in generale.\n\nLa storia segue Quinn e George, due persone che fanno parte dello stesso gruppo di amici. Dopo l'incontro, Quinn (uno spudorato playboy e giocatore professionista di hockey) viene immediatamente affascinato da George, e inizia a inseguirla... ma lei non vuole saperne di lui. È combattuta tra la chimica che si accende tra loro e il passato che dimostra quanto siano sbagliati l'uno per l'altro. Quando George alla fine cede al (considerevole) fascino di Quinn, tutte le scommesse sono chiuse.\nHo davvero apprezzato il modo in cui l’autrice ha gestito il passato da playboy di Quinn.\nIl tipo di libro che è facile da leggere in una sola volta, è una storia d'amore ma anche di crescita personale.\n\nUn libro da 4 ⭐️su 5\n\n#bookptclub2 #bookgrubber #book_lover_instagram #bookloversg2020📚 #pazziperilromance #librodelgiorno #instalibri #magicalstorieswithbook #amanti_di_libri\n#bookbloggeritaliangroup \n#miralynkelly #lavventura #hockeybook #sportromance #bookromance #booklover #booknerd","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/309507042_161834616470335_1883354839365203830_n.jpg?stp=c7.0.1425.1425a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=B_ld5_M0fFEAX9jGfvR&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfA_R3abuB-drh0GWzTx8rnTSNBRbuImaf1J9J67oznqHg&oe=636E389C&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Icebreaker ⛸️🫶🏼🤍\n\nAuthor: @hannahgraceauthor \nGenre: college romance, grumpy sunshine. \nRating: 4,5⭐️\n\nThis were a buddy read with @books.scarlet 🤍\n\nI have enjoyed every second of this book, \nI really love all the side character but not Aaron.
