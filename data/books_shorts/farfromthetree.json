[{"text":"Far from the Tree by Robin Benway\n4⭐️\n\nI really enjoyed reading this book. The writing was very good. The change of pov’s between the siblings was a great idea. It has some serious and very real situations without it being too heavy for the reader. It has a good balance of family, love, loss, and friendship.\nDefinitely recommend reading it\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n#contemporarybooks #contemporaryreads #farfromthetreebook #robinbenwaybooks #bookreview #bookreviewer #bookstagram #booklover #bookworm","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/298359153_771344427246608_4968908323138849314_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=qRrDImh4ALAAX9Txug-&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfA-p6caSQouwT8r_eBXKLu-PX_qDJAUIu3rLGkBaMAWfg&oe=636E64AC&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Šta je za vas porodica?\n.\nKako se to kod nas kaže, iver ne pada daleko od klade. Ovo je priča o porodici, o razumevanju, o onom nečem jedinstvenom i neobjašnjivom što nas veže za naše najbliže.\n.\r\nGrejs ima 16 godina i nedavno se porodila i dala svoju tek rođenu bebu na usvajanje. Jedino ko bi je razumeo, i koga ona tek sad razume, jeste njena biološka majka koja ju je dala na usvajanje čim se rodila. Grejs odlučuje da je potraži, ali prvo saznaje da ima sestru i brata.\n.\r\nNjih troje se upoznaju, zbližavaju i rešavaju da nađu biološku majku. Svo troje prolaze kroz teške trenutke u životu i po prvu put osećaju da nisu sami, da imaju nekog svog na koga se mogu osloniti, iako su do juče bili stranci.\n.\r\nMeni je ova knjiga bila predivna i optimistična, mada me je na trenutke zaista rastužila. Moram da istaknem dva važna utiska:\n.\r\nPrvo, ova knjiga nas uči o značaju porodice, koju ništa ne može da zameni. Krv je nešto od čega ne možemo pobeći. Čak i kad ne opravdavamo njihove postupke, rodbini uvek moramo biti rame za plakanje.\n.\r\nDrugo je taj ceo proces odvajanja majke od deteta. Knjiga nam dočarava ovu temu iz dva ugla: devojke koja je ceo život osuđivala majku koja ju je napustila, a potom te iste devojke koja napušta svoje dete. Takođe pratimo porodice svo troje glavnih likova, i kako se oni prilagođavaju usvojenom detetu.\n.\r\nKroz knjigu sam preispitala svoje stavove o porodici i napuštanju/usvajanju dece. Mislim da sam dosta naučila i ostala još u mislima sa nekim pitanjima na koja valjda i ne postoji odgovor.\n.\nNa kraju, postavlja se pitanje šta uopšte znači biti porodica? Da li je to krvno srodstvo ili zapravo bilo kakva veza koja nas tera da uvek budemo tu jedni za druge, da se podržavamo i bezrezervno volimo?\n.\nOcena: jaka četvorka 4+/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n@robinbenway \n#farfromthetree #farfromthetreebook #robinbenwaybooks #robinbenway #emmyandoliver #citajknjigu #volimknjige #knjigeinstagrama #knjiskimoljac #knjigoljupci #booklover #booknerd #bookstagrambalkan #harperteenbooks @harperteen #readersofinstagram #readmorebooks #readabook #knjigoljubac","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/101666980_2671922973085840_7453287376980184234_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=NDo2MnwfXaMAX_A6ukh&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDecIB1zTRc97WuEwgGXAi_QvtrzxQbqF3oA-o81bgf3Q&oe=636F04FF&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"Book 3 of 2022.

This book is 375 pages of pure love, friendship and so much more!\n.\n.\n📚 description: Being the middle child has its ups and downs.\n\nBut for Grace, an only child who was adopted at birth, discovering that she is a middle child is a different ride altogether. After putting her own baby up for adoption, she goes looking for her biological family, including—\n\nMaya, her loudmouthed younger bio sister, who has a lot to say about their newfound family ties. Having grown up the snarky brunette in a house full of chipper redheads, she’s quick to search for traces of herself among these not-quite-strangers. And when her adopted family’s long-buried problems begin to explode to the surface, Maya can’t help but wonder where exactly it is that she belongs.\n\nAnd Joaquin, their stoic older bio brother, who has no interest in bonding over their shared biological mother. After seventeen years in the foster care system, he’s learned that there are no heroes, and secrets and fears are best kept close to the vest, where they can’t hurt anyone but him.\n.\n.\nI rate this book 5 ⭐️. I highly recommend this book if anyone is a YA reader, someone who loves the show This is Us and for someone who loves books about family. .\n.\nWhat’s your next book that you’re going to read?\n#lgbtbook #youngadultbooks #reading #bookstagram #farfromthetreebook #book #yabooks","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/106051290_309899773364549_3054547059814001719_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=gXPVfTAeNYcAX-rsRWn&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAiCkLY9MZz-I6AjbByQOvLVn3mY8gfO4kzfSYmGJjCmw&oe=636ECBA5&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"@robinbenway is giving me #allthefeels with #farfromthetreebook Reading for #readerschoice #loudinthelibrary #siblings","url":"https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/50713355_312849749418827_399291434396922006_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=9_gUKqHLcDoAX-0RZNu&edm=AOUPxh0BAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBMlTGxJKOU0fCko3vEg06Rv8hI8kXccHAE2J1FxNw1fA&oe=636F75FA&_nc_sid=76ac9f"},{"text":"This book, Far From The Tree, is a must read for everyone in the helping field.

Soon enough, they learn that they're all biological siblings and they start a whole new journey to locate their biological mother while trying to find homes in each other on the way.\n.\nThe story kept unwinding, revealing their flaws, vulnerabilities, trust issues, fear of being judged, fear of not being loved and accepted for who they were or being able to love, uncertainties about each of their choices and their consequences, and above all the question tearing at their hearts of what it truly means to be a family.\n.\n It was very, very well-written and the character developments and transitions were striking. The entire \"teen- phase-situation\" was described in a highly frustrating way but was authentic. You'll know why if you read it. There are a lot of diverse elements in the book like teen pregnancy, racism, dysfunctional family, substance abuse, bullying, etc. and I appreciated how the author accomplished to wrap up everything so evenly. \n.\nThe way they explore and open up to each other about their lives, their bond blooming overtime, the flashes and glimpses of affection slowly turning into the fierce, unexplainable love that ties a family together, and the intense feelings which hold one another was exhibited beautifully. I loved it🥺😭. I can't sum it up correctly, there were way too many elements and heart-wrecking emotions, however, with a sense of hope and fulfillment beneath it all. Also omg?
